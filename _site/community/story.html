		<h2>Story of Transition</h2>

<p>In the summer of 2012, the young adult small group had been meeting for
over three years. The dynamics of the group had changed. Some had
children; new members had joined the group. The group sensed that God
was moving among them, but did not realize exactly what that meant. The
group entered an intentional time of discernment throughout the summer
and fall of 2012.</p>

<p>The group asked the question,</p>

<blockquote><p>Reflecting on what God has taught us, how is He calling this group to
action so that our efforts might be expanded for the benefit of the
church and the community?</p></blockquote>

<p>The group considered possibilities of dividing the group, discontinuing
the ministry or sending out families to begin new groups in the
community. As the group explored its calling, it concluded,</p>

<blockquote><p>God is calling some of us to step out of this existing group in order
to begin (lead) new groups in our church (perhaps missional groups).
Some of us feel that God has called us to stay as this group. This
will open the group to others (allowing this group to be accessible)
so that they may be discipled as we have been.</p></blockquote>

<p>We did not know exactly how this would play out, but we knew that God
was calling this group to something different, something that would open
the door for new people to engage. Around the same time, Matt and I
attended a conference in Fort Wayne about missional communities. As we
explored the dynamics of this approach, we felt that God was calling us
toward this direction.</p>

<p>We began reading, exploring and considering this approach to
discipleship and community. A team of four members was formed to map
this out. Colleen Massoth, Tim Stigers, David Rodriguez, Heather Headley
and I began meeting to discuss how we might begin a similar approach
that was contextual to First Baptist Church Muncie.</p>

<p>In our process, we explored the values of First Baptist Church Muncie;
we even rummaged through scrapbooks from Sunday School classes from 60
years ago. We discovered that the values of previous generations (Sunday
School classes) were the same as the values for these communities. While
the world looks much different, the dynamics of living life together
have not changed. The format of missional communities will be different
from Sunday School, but the values will be similar. The groups will be
on mission together in the community; they will spend time in close
fellowship (through Life Groups) and will support one another through
the good and bad that life brings.</p>

<p>The team felt that God was leading this direction. We sensed that God
was prompting us to give this format a shot.</p>

<h2>Plan for Pilot Group</h2>

<p>The team turned to a model for missional communities out of England.
Europe has experienced cultural changes we are now experiencing in
America. Church attendance among adults is plummeting; the church is no
longer the center of culture. Mike Breen and Alex Absalom, in <em>Launching
Missional Communities: A Field Guide</em> detail the approach in St. Thomas'
Church in Sheffield, England fifteen years ago. He suggests beginning
with a pilot community. It is a way to test out the format and learn
from the experience.</p>

<p>We plan to have a pilot community at First Baptist Church Muncie in
2013. In the month of January, we will have an informational meeting
(Wednesday, January 9) for those who are interested in participating in
the community. Participants will have a chance to sign up for Life
Groups through January 20. The community will begin in February 2013 and
will conclude at the end of May 2013.</p>

<h2>What are Missional Communities?</h2>

<p>There has been much written about missional communities. I will try to
keep this brief, but I would like to give you an idea of what we are
talking about. Wikipedia defines missional communities as,</p>

<blockquote><p>groups of &hellip; people who are united, through Christian community,
around a common service and witness to a particular neighborhood or
network of relationships. With a strong value on life together, the
group has the expressed intention of seeing those they impact choose
to start following Jesus, through this more flexible and locally
incarnated expression of the church.</p></blockquote>

<p>In short, missional communities are mid-sized (25-50 people) and serve
to connect people in the work of God in our community. They are larger
than small groups, but they are smaller than worship gatherings.
Sociologists have concluded that this group size is ideal for mission
projects. They are often centered on a particular geographic region or
mission focus.</p>

<p>In larger church settings, there may be several missional communities.
But for us, we will begin with one. The missional community will meet
twice a month. They will meet on the first Wednesday of each month for a
meal and fellowship. They will gather for a mission/service project on
the third week of each month.</p>

<h2>What are Life Groups?</h2>

<p>While missional communities are ideal sized for projects, they are a bit
large for life-on-life connections. Embedded in missional communities
will be Life Groups of 6-12 people. They will meet on the second and
fourth week of each month for Bible study, prayer and fellowship -
living the Christian life together. For now, we will have an open sign
up and divide interested participants into Life Groups for the duration
of the Pilot Group (February-May 2013).</p>

<p>Life Groups will meet in homes; the date and time will be determined by
the Life Groups themselves. Leaders will also meet on the first and
third week of each month for training and sharing.</p>

<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>

<p>You might be asking, how can I get involved? The first way would be to
attend the January 9 informational meeting. Come and find out more about
how these groups will function. If you would like to be involved in a
Life Group, you will have an opportunity to sign up through January 20.</p>

<p>If you choose to be involved in the pilot community, you will have an
opportunity to connect with others, serve on Mission projects together
and be involved in a Life Group. Again a typical monthly schedule will
look like this.</p>

<ul>
<li>First week - Meal and Sharing Time at Church on Wednesday evening</li>
<li>Second week - Life Groups in homes</li>
<li>Third week - Mission project</li>
<li>Fourth week - Life Groups in homes</li>
<li>Fifth week (if there is one) - no meetings</li>
</ul>


<h2>This is a test, only a test &hellip;</h2>

<p>Perhaps you are listening to the radio and hear a long beep. The
broadcaster usually says something like, &ldquo;this is a test, only a test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This pilot group is only a test. We hope that we will find that these
gatherings are life transforming. We hope that this pattern of ministry
will prove fruitful and that we will continue it beyond the pilot group.
At the same time, we hope to learn from mistakes as we navigate these
new waters together.</p>

<p>I hope that you will join us as we explore new ways of discipleship and
mission.</p>
