 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to update you on the status of our recent decision to change our Sunday morning schedule. We are planning on making the change the week after Easter. It has been a long road of listening, discerning and listening a bit more. Yet it seems that it is time to pull the trigger on the change. &lt;!-- more --&gt;With most of the congregation supportive, a leadership team ready to make any unforeseen adjustments and a natural shift in seasons (Spring), it seems that the timing is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it is worth noting, a decision is never really over. In our discernment process, the final stage is about communication. Once a decision has been reached, it is important to tell the story of the process. Why did we make this decision? How did God seem to be leading us as we discerned? Especially for those who were minimally involved in the process, they need to hear the story over and over again. But the decision is not closed. While it probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to go back to the drawing board, the posture of implementation is one of open ears. Were their facets of the decision that we did not consider? Is there new information that may prompt us to tweak the implementation? The final stage is one of communication, but it also one of continual listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem confusing, especially to those who are type A personalities (like myself). We like to decide and then get it done. The last thing we want to do is receive new information that may require us to adjust. We like a well devised plan; we like to execute. I am not suggesting that we constantly question our decision. Certainly, God was involved in the process and led us to this place. Yet, we must recognize that God continues to speak, to act, to move. Is there more to learn? I am almost sure of it. Do we have it all figured out? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say that the discerning process is continual. Sure we make decisions and implement those decisions. But we must be careful to keep open ears to God&amp;rsquo;s continual speaking into the decisions we have made. We might be required to adjust as we move forward. This probably makes little sense from a business leadership perspective. Yet we are a spiritual community constantly seeking the direction of our Father. May God give us the patience and persistence to discern his ways. As church leaders, we are not simply here to make efficient organizations or to please the most people. We are called to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. Ultimately, we strive to be a community of faith collectively discerning God&amp;rsquo;s movement. May we each pray, as we discussed Sunday morning in worship, David&amp;rsquo;s prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 19:14 NIV) May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 		<title>Fortitude and Flexibility</title>

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on the dynamic of discernment, I am living in the tension of process and free-flowing forms of interaction. We want to be intentional about moving forward. At the same time, we want to be open to the movement of the Holy Spirit. Are these dynamic incompatible? Can they co-exist?&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I struggle with how to make sense of this, it seems the key lies in submission. Following the Spirit is often an excuse for laziness or inaction. We sit back, fail to do what God is calling us do. All the while, we insist we are waiting on the Spirit. In the other extreme, we lay our plans and work the system; nothing will distract us from our goal. In truth, we are not submitting to God; we are submitting to our plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Common-Prayer-Ordinary-Radicals-ebook/dp/B003V4B574/ref=kinw_dp_ke?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;m;=AG56TWVU5XWC2&quot;&gt;Common Prayer: A Liturgy for Ordinary Radicals&lt;/a&gt; this week, I was blown away by this quote from from Jesuit Jean-Pierre de Caussade (18th Century).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great and firm foundation of the spiritual life is the offering of ourselves to God and being subject to his will in all things. We must completely forget ourselves, so that we regard ourselves as an object which has been sold and over which we no longer have any rights. We find all our joy in fulfilling God’s pleasure — his happiness, his glory and the fact that he is our great and only delight. Once we have this foundation, all we need to do is spend our lives rejoicing that God is God and being so wholly abandoned to his will that we are quite indifferent as to what we do and equally indifferent as to what use he makes of our activities. &lt;a href=&quot;Claiborne,&quot;&gt;^fn1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submission and pursuit at the same time. We are called to actively submit to God&amp;rsquo;s activity in our life. We will continue to live in this tension between fortitude and flexibility. I would be interested in how you understand this tension.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Test Post</title>

 		<updated>2012-02-01T11:03:37-05:00</updated>
 		<id>http://demo.fbcmuncie.org/blog/watching-to-learn</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I generally read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Common-Prayer-Ordinary-Radicals-ebook/dp/B003V4B574/ref=kinw_dp_ke?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;m;=AG56TWVU5XWC2&quot;&gt;Common Prayer: A Liturgy for Ordinary Radicals&lt;/a&gt;. The book is designed for community reading, but it works well as a devotion. It leads me into focused prayer and provides Scripture for reflection.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I was reading Genesis 24:1-27. This is the story of Abraham&amp;rsquo;s servant being commissioned to find Isaac&amp;rsquo;s wife. The servant is doubtful that he will succeed; yet after agreeing on provisions, he agrees to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 24:9 NIV) So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it might seem awkward placing our hand under our master&amp;rsquo;s thigh, this is how they did it in those days :). Anyway, he packs his bags and heads off to Abraham&amp;rsquo;s homeland. As I read the story, I was struck by the servant&amp;rsquo;s dependance on God&amp;rsquo;s leading. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t devise a strategic plan for finding Isaac&amp;rsquo;s wife; he doesn&amp;rsquo;t gather a team to plan his trip. He simply heads off trusting God to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 24:12 NIV) Then he prayed, “O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He understands that he cannot succeed on his own. He continues to ask God for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 24:13–14 NIV)  13) See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. 14) May it be that when I say to a girl, ‘Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels too’ — let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pleads for direction, for God&amp;rsquo;s will to be accomplished in this deal. He knows his task is difficult. He will need to convince the future wife to leave her homeland, her family. He understands the drawbacks for the chosen girl. As you continue to read the story, the young girl fulfills the servant&amp;rsquo;s request to God. In v. 21, we find the posture of the servant; this is what it means to discern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 24:21 NIV) Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that phrase &amp;ldquo;the man watched &amp;hellip; closely to learn&amp;rdquo;. What a great definition of discerning. This is what it means to discern God&amp;rsquo;s movement in the world. I fear that we are often so busy working the plan that we fail to &amp;ldquo;watch closely to learn.&amp;rdquo; The rest is history. There are a few more twists and turns along the way, but ultimately this is the girl for Isaac. In the end, the servant worships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 24:26–27 NIV)  26) Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, 27) saying, “Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May we be a discerning people who &amp;ldquo;watch closely to learn&amp;rdquo; what God is doing in our midst. May we be suspicious of orderly plans that leave God&amp;rsquo;s movements out of the equation. May we, like Abraham&amp;rsquo;s servant, understand our dependance on God.&lt;/p&gt;
