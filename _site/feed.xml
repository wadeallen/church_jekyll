 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day, we take a break from the David series to travel a bit further back in time. We reflect on the story of Samuel&amp;rsquo;s mother, Hannah. As a barren woman she was grief stricken. God comes to her in her brokenness and provides a child. Through this story, we learn much about what it means to be a mother. At the same time, we also learn what it means to bring our heartache to God.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems that the nation of Israel is heading to destruction. The elected king has been rejected by God. The prophet Samuel is bummed out wondering what is next for this people. All the while, God is working and moving on a Judean hillside. As we study 1 Samuel 15:34-16:13 together, we find that God&amp;rsquo;s plan is not always the plan that we might choose. Yet, God&amp;rsquo;s choice is always for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

At the same time, we will touch on God&amp;rsquo;s preference for those who authentically seek him. David&amp;rsquo;s heart is one of passion and purpose. We will be challenged as we explore the story together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we begin Holy Week, we will walk through the story of Jesus&#39; arrest and crucifixion. Jesus&#39; control and determination to fulfill his mission are stunning. He could have called it off at any point. Yet, he willingly steps into pain, suffering, humiliation in order to rescue us.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2014/04/07/laser-focus</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sunday begins the most significant week on the church calendar. Palm Sunday kicks off the journey of Jesus to the Cross. Certainly, his journey began before Palm Sunday, but this final week of Jesus&#39; life on earth gives us the opportunity to reflect on the intensity of Jesus&#39; suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lectionary text this year is very long. It spans across two chapters (Matthew 26-27). We will walk through the story on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of this message will be Jesus&#39; ability to call it off at any time. We are told in Matthew 26:53 that Jesus can escape at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 26:53 NIV) Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A legion numbers between 3000 and 6000 soldiers. That means that Jesus had up to 72000 angels at his disposal. As we reflect on Jesus&#39; suffering, this fact highlights Jesus&#39; laser focus. He was intent on fulfilling the will of the Father, on carrying out His act of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you will plan on spending time next week (Holy Week) in this story. Let me remind you of a special Good Friday service at First Baptist on &lt;em&gt;Friday, April 18&lt;/em&gt; at First Baptist. Pastor Willie Jackson of Union Missionary Baptist Church will be speaking. We will gather with Christians from all over Muncie to reflect on Jesus&#39; Passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Why Jesus Healed</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2014/03/31/why-jesus-healed"/>
 		<updated>2014-03-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2014/03/31/why-jesus-healed</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why Jesus performed miracles? Certainly the recipients of the miracles benefited from their encounter with Jesus. Yet if you think about it, all of the people who were healed by Jesus eventually died. Even Lazarus, who was resurrected from the tomb, died again. At best, the miracles were temporary. So why did Jesus spend time healing disease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The miracles of Jesus reveal to us God&amp;rsquo;s plan for Creation. We must be careful to not isolate the miracles, making them more about the recipients. Sure, God&amp;rsquo;s grace was celebrated in each case. The once blind man, the woman healed with the issue of blood and the once demon-possessed man were set free from their suffering. But their healing was not solely for them. Jesus, through his miracles, was proving his identity. He was revealing God&amp;rsquo;s restoration of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, our study will be in John 11. The infamous story of the resurrection of Lazarus reveals God&amp;rsquo;s heart for the suffering of this fallen world. Jesus stands at the graveside of a friend and weeps. It is easy to understand this story from our perspective. We too cry at funerals. We are saddened by the disconnect that death brings. Yet, I have a hunch that Jesus&#39; tears reflect a deeper reality. With the Cross in view, Jesus calls a man who has been dead for four days from the tomb. In doing so, he reveals his power over sin and death. With tears streaming his face, he let the world know that he was the Christ come to redeem a fallen world. We must not read John 11 apart from Genesis 3. They are connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, John tells us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(John 11:45 NIV) Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why Jesus healed. His miracles were to show the world who He was and what He had come to do. Join us on Sunday as we explore the story together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In John 9, Jesus heals a blind man. Yet this is only part of the story. John frames this story around the disciples&#39; discussion of blindness and the religious leaders&#39; discussion of the miracle. When Jesus restores sight to a blind man, he is making a point about what it means to spiritually see.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Easter Plans</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2014/03/13/easter-plans"/>
 		<updated>2014-03-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2014/03/13/easter-plans</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Easter comes late this year. The latest possible date for Easter is April 25. A few of you might remember when it last occurred on that date (1943). The next time it falls on the latest possible date will be 2038. All the same, Easter falls on &lt;strong&gt;April 20&lt;/strong&gt; this year. This gives us plenty of time for the grass to green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to fill you in on Easter plans at First Baptist. Easter is a high point in worship for Christians throughout the world. It is day when we celebrate the Risen Christ. We are going to veer from our usual plans a bit this year. Instead of coming together for one service, we are going to hold two services with distinct styles. As we do each week, the early service will begin at &lt;strong&gt;9:15 AM&lt;/strong&gt; and the late service will be at &lt;strong&gt;10:45 AM&lt;/strong&gt;. Having two services will give each planning team the opportunity to celebrate each style in full. Having two times will also allow for families with out of town plans to worship early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brunch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, we have held an Easter brunch during the early worship hour. This year, we will have a lighter self-serve brunch between services (&lt;strong&gt;10:15-10:45 AM&lt;/strong&gt;). This will give everyone a chance to be together on this special Sunday. We would encourage everyone to plan to have breakfast at First Baptist on Easter Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Good Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final note about Holy Week: First Baptist will host the community-wide Good Friday service at noon. Willie Jackson, pastor at Union Missionary Baptist Church, will be preaching. Willie is a powerful preacher and joining our Christian brothers and sisters on this special day will certainly be a treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that you all will mark your calendars for these dates.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Birth</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2014/03/10/birth"/>
 		<updated>2014-03-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2014/03/10/birth</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we were watching home videos. We came across videos of Anna and Dawson&amp;rsquo;s birth. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry; they were not too graphic. As they watched the screen, I wondered how it might feel to experience your birth (even if it is by video). I asked them if it was a little strange to watch the event of their birth. They agreed that it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of us remember the day we were born. At the same time, it was probably one of the most traumatic experiences of our life. We moved from one world to the next. We were comfortable in our mother&amp;rsquo;s womb. We were warm, cozy. Worries of this world were non-existent. In a few moments (or sometimes hours), we transitioned into a world that required us to eat, breath; the world as we knew it was no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how Jesus describes our transition into the Kingdom of God. He relates it to a birth. While we do not crawl back into our mother&amp;rsquo;s womb, the transition is no less dramatic. On Sunday, we will overhear a conversation between Jesus and a religious leader named Nicodemus. Nicodemus was trying to figure out who Jesus was. He had seen the miracles and believed that Jesus was from God. Yet he did not know how to sort it  out. Jesus uses his seeking posture as a way to teach us about the dynamics of conversion. Join us on Sunday as we explore John 3:1–16.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Overcoming Temptation</title>
 		<link href="/video/2014/03/09/overcoming-temptation"/>
 		<updated>2014-03-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/video/2014/03/09/overcoming-temptation</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we enter the season of Lent, we explore the temptations of Jesus in the desert. We learn that Jesus does what Adam could not do. He stands up the temptations to veer from the Father&amp;rsquo;s will. His strength provides the power in our own temptations.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Fighting Temptation</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2014/03/03/fighting-temptation"/>
 		<updated>2014-03-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2014/03/03/fighting-temptation</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, we enter the season of Lent. It is a time when we think about &lt;em&gt;giving up&lt;/em&gt;, laying down something that we enjoy. For the next 40+ days, we find ourselves tempted with the lure of what we have given up. For some, it is a favorite snack or food. For others, it is an activity, like TV or video games. Each time we are tempted to return, we remember Jesus&#39; temptation to avoid the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, we find Jesus in the wilderness. He is famished; he has not eaten for 40 days. The devil comes to him and attempts to throw him off course. He makes at least three efforts to lure Jesus away from the Father&amp;rsquo;s will. In each instance, Jesus is faced with an easier route, a shortcut. But Jesus is faithful, resisting until the devil flees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we study the Temptations of Jesus, we are reminded of our own temptations. We consider the ways in which we are attacked by the evil one each day. Jesus models for us a strategy for temptation. He keeps His eye on the Father&amp;rsquo;s plan and refuses to bend to the schemes of the evil one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we must be careful to understand Jesus&#39; stand as the antithesis to Adam&amp;rsquo;s failure. Adam&amp;rsquo;s defeat impacted us all. We were booted from the Garden and forced to live in a broken world. Jesus, on the other hand, restores what Adam destroyed. Paul puts it this way,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 Corinthians 15:22 NIV) For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we face temptations each day, we can mimic our father Adam or follow the example of Jesus. Just as Adam&amp;rsquo;s response led to death, falling into temptation will ultimately destroy us. Yet when we follow Jesus&#39; example of resisting the lures of the dark one, we will find life. Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 4:1-11 together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Without an Associate Pastor</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2014/02/23/without-an-associate-pastor"/>
 		<updated>2014-02-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2014/02/23/without-an-associate-pastor</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the ground begins to thaw (hopefully), we continue to experience change at First Baptist. It was wonderful to experience Matt&amp;rsquo;s ordination at the end of February; we now face the reality of his absence. What does that mean for us? Who will do the work that he has been doing? What is going to happen next? While some questions remain unanswered, I would like to fill you in on what we do know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Media/Sound Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been fortunate in that we have had several months to prepare for Matt&amp;rsquo;s departure. We have been careful to identify unfinished projects that would help us as we learn to live without Matt. Two main projects have to do with the sound and media equipment. We have aging technology that hinders our ability to streamline our sound and media. We have identified weak links in our technology and are in the process of replacing the sound board and projector. These improvements will make it easier for the sound and media volunteers. While Matt did much of this work, we will be able to function primarily with volunteers in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leading Worship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious question has to do with worship leadership. Matt has been able to equip volunteers in many areas, but having a key person to lead is important. We have identified three students who will work in this area. Jericho ?? has been working with the choir for several weeks now. He will continue this learning experience. Two others students from Taylor University have agreed to work with the praise band in the late service. They will rotate responsibilities each week. It is exciting to offer these opportunities to students who are looking for the experience to lead. We will continue to serve as an equipping church as we empower students to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coordinating Worship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading worship is a visible way in which Matt served the church. But the &lt;em&gt;behind-the-scenes&lt;/em&gt; planning required much time and attention. Who will do this work? While Julie Kirklin serves as Worship Coordinator, it would be impossible for her to carry the weight of this responsibility alone. A team will work together to organize and plan the worship services. Dana Davis will be the early service coordinator. She will organize a team to do the work of planning early worship. Adam and Jessica Fink will serve as late service coordinators. They will arrange the various pieces each week, relying on team members to take care of particular aspects of worship. I will work with the coordinators, giving and receiving information to plan worship each week. Certainly this model requires volunteers to take on more responsibility. At the same time, this sort of approach allows for members of the church to be involved, expressing their gifts for the building up of the body. As Paul wrote to the church at Corinth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 Corinthians 12:27 NIV) Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Replacing our Associate Pastor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been asked several times, &lt;em&gt;Are we going to replace Matt?&lt;/em&gt; The question might be phrased &lt;em&gt;Are we going to hire another Associate Pastor who leads worship?&lt;/em&gt; The immediate answer is that we are not sure. This is a question that needs time and attention. We plan to work through our discernment process (the one that we have used on a number of occasions) to discern God&amp;rsquo;s plan in this area. We are certainly a different congregation than we were four years ago. We have different needs and God may be calling us in new ways. We need to figure this out. The beauty of the discernment process is that allows for everyone to have a voice. Opportunities for your feedback will come as we work the process. It will take several months to do the work involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decreasing staff is never an easy transition. I am sure that we will find tasks that go undone. At the same time, I am confident that the church will step up to the challenge. I am sure that God will provide for all that He is calling us to do.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sunday is a very special day in the life of First Baptist Church Muncie. It is a day to celebrate what God has done. At the same time, it will not be an easy day as we say goodbye (for now) to dear friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we gather for combined worship at 10:45, we will ordain Matt Headley into the Gospel ministry. We will gather for a meal following the service to bid the Headley family a warm farewell. You are invited to bring your favorite dish to share, meat and drinks will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we worship together, we will be considering Peter&amp;rsquo;s instruction to church leaders. His words remind us of the role of church leaders and the importance of their work. While Matt has been active in ministry for several years, this service marks an official commissioning for the work that he will spend his life pursuing. It is appropriate to remind him of the necessary posture of this work. Peter instructs church elders (leaders, pastors) to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 Peter 5:2 NIV) Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, serving as overseers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will explore this chapter on Sunday as we send Matt forward to serve the Kingdom. I hope that everyone will be able to attend this momentous occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Examining The Heart</title>

 		<updated>2014-02-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/video/2014/02/16/examining-the-heart</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the season of Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, we think a lot about hearts. In Matthew 5:21-37, Jesus is not talking about romantic love. He calls us to examine our hearts in terms of sin. As we continue our study on Jesus&#39; words, we are challenged to allow God to do the inner work of transforming our hearts. Adjusting our actions is impossible without a change of heart.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Hearts</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2014/02/10/hearts"/>
 		<updated>2014-02-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2014/02/10/hearts</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are celebrating a holiday this week. If you have a boyfriend/girlfriend or spouse, you had better not forget. It is a day that we celebrate love (mostly romantic love). We buy candy, write love letters; flowers sometimes come along with the deal. You might think that we would reflect on love this week in worship. Certainly, love is a powerful theme in Scripture. God&amp;rsquo;s love (agape) for us outshines our frail love for each other. However, we are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; talking about love this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our text for the week, however, deals with the heart. We are not talking about the red ones that you will see hanging around. We are talking about the ancient understanding of the heart. The heart was considered the inmost part of one&amp;rsquo;s being. It was considered the center of a person. While a person might temporarily adjust one&amp;rsquo;s actions, true change does not take place if it does not first begin in the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus understood this truth. As we continue our study of Matthew 5 (The Sermon on the Mount), Jesus&#39; expectations for his follows seem to reach an impossible level. He speaks of anger, lust, marriage and divorce. He demolishes the systems set up by the religious leaders around these sins. They had neatly ordered the sins and compartmentalized levels of rule-breaking. Yet Jesus sets the bar high, even to an unachievable degree. Can anyone live up to this teaching? How can we possibly measure up to these standards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 5:21–37. Jesus calls us to not only consider our actions but also our hearts. We will realize that we can not do this alone. We will need a source outside of us if we are ever going to live up to Kingdom standards. May we allow God to transform us from the deepest levels of our being so that can follow him authentically.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 5:13-16, Jesus challenges His followers to be salt and light. Through these tangible symbols, Jesus describes the impact that we should make in our world. Through His power, we can change the world in which we live.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Impacting our World</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2014/02/04/impacting-our-world"/>
 		<updated>2014-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2014/02/04/impacting-our-world</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We come to another familiar text this week in our lectionary reading. Moving forward with the Sermon on the Mount, we will study Jesus&#39; description of his followers impact on their world. He uses two familiar images to describe their influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first image is &lt;em&gt;salt&lt;/em&gt;. Jesus tells them,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 5:13 NIV) “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often think of modern day salt shakers, but in the first century salt served a broader purpose. It was used to purify, to preserve, to enhance. We will talk about the ways that Jesus calls us to be salt in our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, he tells us that we are &lt;em&gt;light&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 5:14–16 NIV) “You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember Jesus referring to himself as the &lt;em&gt;light of the world&lt;/em&gt; in John&amp;rsquo;s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(John 8:12 NIV) When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus assures us that we will carry on His mission of bringing light to this dark world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we study this text, we are challenged to examine the way we interact with our world. Whether we are teachers, employees, employers, neighbors, family members, students, workers, coaches or athletes (the list could go on and on), we are called to be salt and light. Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 5:13-16 together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2014/01/28/blessed</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be blessed? We all want blessings; we want to live a blessed life. But what do we mean? If we pressed the issue, many of us would define the word as having to do with economic success or a life free of pain and suffering. We might even speak of having family and friends who support us. These are the typical ways we define &lt;em&gt;blessings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when Jesus shows up and considers the &lt;em&gt;blessed&lt;/em&gt;, he has entirely different categories. In this week&amp;rsquo;s text (Matthew 5:1-12), we will be exploring what many refer to as &lt;em&gt;The Beatitudes&lt;/em&gt; (Latin for Blessings). Jesus&#39; description of &lt;em&gt;the blessed&lt;/em&gt; may surprise you. In fact we often consider those in his sermon cursed. His message flies in the face of our cultural understanding of &lt;em&gt;blessed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 5:1-12 together. I would encourage you to take few minutes to read the passage as you prepare for worship.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 4:12-23 Jesus leaves his hometown to begin his ministry. His actions are decisive; there is no turning back. He invites others to join Him on His mission. They too are quick to respond. They drop everything (right in the middle of their work) to join him. As we study this text together, we are reminded of what it looks like to follow Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a one track mind. My family would tell you that I am often in another world when I am focused on a particular task. Because of this, I do not like to be interrupted in my work. I like to finish what I have started before I move on to something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our text this week, Jesus interrupts four men. They are busy making a living (fishing) and Jesus seems to catch them in the middle of their job. Their response could have been, &amp;ldquo;Hold on Jesus, let me finish this up and I will be with you.&amp;rdquo; In fact, we see this in other places in Scripture. In Luke 9, we find a list of excuse ridden would-be disciples. But these four guys are different. Their response is immediate. We read of Peter and his brother Andrew,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 4:20 NIV) At once they left their nets and followed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James and John have the same response,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 4:22 NIV) immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aversion to interruption is challenged in this passage. The response of these men calls us to respond in like ways. The call of God requires us to action. Now. Are we willing for our lives to be interrupted by God? Are we likely to ask God for an extension of time? May we be challenged to hear and obey the voice of God. May our response be as immediate as Peter, Andrew, James and John. Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 4:12–23 together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>A Significant Contribution</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2014/01/16/a-significant-contribution"/>
 		<updated>2014-01-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2014/01/16/a-significant-contribution</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have little experience at First Baptist Muncie without the Headleys. Not long after I arrived, Barb Eidson found a young piano student at Ball State named Heather Parker. We were looking for someone to lead worship and found out that Heather&amp;rsquo;s fiancé was a worship leader; he felt that God was calling him into ministry. The next step for him was seminary.  God soon orchestrated a full scholarship for Matt at Northern Seminary and we hired him part-time as Worship Arts Director. It all worked out perfectly. A few months later, Matt and Heather were married and moved to Muncie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Baptist has been training ground for Matt. He commuted back and fourth to Chicago each week for the first three years. Taking what he learned in textbooks, he was able to test it out in real life ministry. As Matt encountered new ideas, he tried them out in this ministry context. We have experienced new forms of worship, discipleship and leadership as Matt has contributed to the life of this church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Worship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt, The Headley&amp;rsquo;s contribution to worship has been significant. Matt has taught us to think deeply about the order of worship. He has studied ancient models of liturgy and has incorporated applicable parts into worship at First Baptist. You might think that moving the offering until the end of the service would create havoc. But Matt was able to articulate theological convictions about how we worship and why we participate in each aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt has also been intentional about involving others in worship planning. He believes that worship is the work of the people, not simply the work of the pastor. With this we have experienced more testimonies, creative components and out-of-the-box ways of carrying out worship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt is not alone in his contribution to the church&amp;rsquo;s worship. Heather has been active in the praise band sharing her gifts in music. In fact, she has been active in aiding our worship through music longer than Matt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Discipleship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Headley&amp;rsquo;s have offered much in terms of discipleship. Matt prompted the conversation that began the process of planning what is now our Missional Communities. He and I traveled to Fort Wayne to attend a conference that spawned the idea for these communities. Heather was on the planning team for our pilot community a little over a year ago. Not only have they helped to guide overall church discipleship, Matt and Heather have been involved in many of your lives personally, helping you to grow in Christ. It is difficult to quantify their contribution; we will not fully realize their discipleship impact until we are all able to celebrate God&amp;rsquo;s work in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Heather have helped us transition as a congregation in terms of leadership. We are learning how to live into our new polity. We are moving toward a team model of ministry in which we all use our gifts for the sake of Christ&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom. As leaders, it has been necessary to call on members to take responsibility for areas of ministry. Matt&amp;rsquo;s role has always been less than full-time at First Baptist; he has been required to depend on you to carry out much of the ministry. He and Heather have empowered many of you to serve. For this, we are deeply grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be impossible to highlight every contribution that Matt and Heather have made to First Baptist. However, I wanted to point out that their years with us have been years of impact. We are not the same because of the Headleys. They have impacted us; we are thankful for the years that God has given us together. At the same time, we will miss them tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that others will benefit from their gifts in the future and pray that God would continue to empower their ministry in the Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John the Baptist was deemed the greatest man every born by Jesus. He was faithful to God&amp;rsquo;s calling to live in the desert, eat locusts and honey, preach a bold and offensive message. In fact, he would be killed for valiant message. Yet when Jesus approaches him for baptism, John&amp;rsquo;s initial response was to forbid Jesus. We will explore how John&amp;rsquo;s tendency continues to be our own experience.

 		<id>/blog/2014/01/06/saying-no-to-jesus</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I remember a preacher asking if we would be will to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; as long as we were certain that God was calling us. Fearful of ending up in an African hut, I was not sure if I could agree. As I have grown older, I have come to realize that God is worthy of our trust. Yet is is sometimes difficult to follow Him when the path seem unreasonable. Our text this week bring us to a situation where a God-follower is hesitant to heed Jesus&amp;rsquo;s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus and John had grown up together; they were relatives. In adulthood, John sensed God&amp;rsquo;s calling to move to the desert and live on a diet of locusts and honey. He proclaimed a message of repentance challenging people to respond to God&amp;rsquo;s working in the world. He was busy doing his work when Jesus showed up with a strange request. Jesus wanted John to baptize him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did not make sense to John. He somehow knew that Jesus was sinless; He did not need to be baptized. John felt unworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 3:13–14 NIV) Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this verse fascinating. The KJV translates this verse,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 3:14 KJV) But John forbad him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To forbid Jesus seems crazy. Most of us would agree that Jesus deserves our obedience. Yet we sometimes we too forbid Him. We reject His direction when it does not seem to fit our plans. Join us on Sunday as we explore this passage together. Matthew 3:13-17&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the building at First Baptist Church Muncie will be 85 years old. While church buildings did not become common practice until about the third century, modern expressions of the church are often indistinguishable from their buildings. The church is certainly not the building. At the same time, our building is a beautiful declaration of who we are and what we believe. Bill Eidson, retired history professor at Ball State University, will reflect on the symbolism and design of our 85 year old building.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this fourth Sunday of Advent, we explore the first few verses of Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Romans.

 		<title>The Right Gift</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/12/18/the-right-gift"/>
 		<updated>2013-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/12/18/the-right-gift</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What gift do you hope to receive this Christmas? Certainly our attention is on gifts this time of year. We have our lists, our budgets and many of us are off to the stores this weekend to pick up last minute gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue our Advent series, Paul reminds us that we have already received the greatest gift possible. As Paul begins his letter to the Romans, he reminds them of his role. He understands his role as servant/slave of Jesus and called to proclaim the good news (gospel) to the Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Romans 1:1–2 NIV) Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God — the gospel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He describes himself as having received &lt;em&gt;grace&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;apostleship&lt;/em&gt; to extend this good news to the people at Rome. The word &lt;em&gt;grace&lt;/em&gt; is the Greek word &lt;em&gt;charis&lt;/em&gt;. It is often translated as &lt;em&gt;gift&lt;/em&gt;. It is a very common word in the New Testament; it is one of Paul&amp;rsquo;s favorite words. The word is used 155 times in the New Testament; Paul uses it 100 times (24 times in the book of Romans alone). Romans has more occurrences of this word than any other book in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;charis&lt;/em&gt; (grace/gift)? It is by definition something that we do not deserve. If we have earned it, it is not a gift. How has &lt;em&gt;charis&lt;/em&gt; been manifested? Notice verse 6,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Romans 1:6 NIV) And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we prepare for Christmas (buying gifts), may we remember that we have received an incredible gift through Jesus. We now belong to Him. It might sound a bit cliche-ish to say something like &lt;em&gt;Jesus is the Reason for the Season&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Gift of all is Jesus&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip; Yet it is important to remind ourselves that our lives &lt;em&gt;in Christ&lt;/em&gt; are a gift. Any worldly gift we give or receive this season is pale in comparison to this truth. May we not forget it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we explore Romans 1:1–7. Also, don&amp;rsquo;t forget the Christmas Eve Candlelight/Communion service at 7:00 PM on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this third Sunday of Advent, we consider the value of patience. In a world that is not yet right, we are tempted to distrust God, to complain, to grumble. But just as God has been faithful in the past (Jesus&#39; coming at Christmas), He will be faithful in the future (His Second Coming). As we live in between these two events, we must be patient.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Joining Life Groups</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/12/10/joining-life-groups"/>
 		<updated>2013-12-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/12/10/joining-life-groups</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we step into 2014, I am hopeful for the future of First Baptist Church Muncie. While we have undergone significant adjustments in recent years, we are experiencing new life in many areas. We begin our second year in our experimental ministry called Missional Communities. I would like to briefly discuss the progress of this ministry and encourage everyone to consider being involved on some level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eddie Gibbs in his book &lt;em&gt;ChurchNext : Quantum Changes in How We Do Ministry&lt;/em&gt; describes the need for churches to attempt new models of ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a culture of chaos, experimentation and risk taking are the order of the day. p. 34&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began this ministry in February 2013. During a summer break and now winter break we are finding ways to adjust the program. In August, we experienced the dynamic of older congregates joining Life Groups. The intergenerational groups have been immensely rewarding for the group members (younger and older alike). We hope that the Spring groups will find additional members from all generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we have found that our monthly Wednesday evening meeting has not been helpful for most participants. Weeknight obligations make it difficult for most to attend. Therefore, we are adjusting our monthly meetings to Sunday afternoons. We are designing social events on the first Sunday of each month for the intermingling of Life Groups. We will give this a try and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we approach each coming year, we will likely find it necessary to shift ministry approaches. Our world is changing at ever increasing rates; we must be willing and able to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missional Communities are a model of ministry that facilitates relationships. The purpose of social events, Life Groups and mission projects is to challenge the members of First Baptist Muncie to live in accountable connections with one another. Gibbs later describes the need for churches to build commitment of its members to one another. In other words, we must become a family of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge facing the church is to move its members from a casual and contractual relationship to a covenant.  A covenantal relationship entails a commitment to one another through thick and thin. p. 152&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missional Communities have the potential to do this. Are you currently involved in Missional Communities? Would you consider joining a Life Group in 2014? Please let me know if this is a step you would be willing to take in this new year.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Woven Fabric</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/12/09/woven-fabric"/>
 		<updated>2013-12-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/12/09/woven-fabric</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got an email this week from a young woman in our congregation. She has recently read Jerry Bridges&#39; book &lt;em&gt;The Practice of Godliness&lt;/em&gt;. I am familiar with this book. Originally published in 1983, a second edition came out in 1996. Around that time, I used this book with a group of college students for a weekend retreat. Bridges challenges us to pay attention to the various facets of a godly life. In his chapter on patience, he says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian character is like a single garment woven from threads of varying colors and shades. From a distance the garment appears to be a single color, but closer examination reveals that it takes a combination of different colored threads to produce the overall effect. The casual observer is not too concerned with those various threads; he notices and appreciates the garments overall effect. The creator of that cloth has to consider each thread individually, ensuring that the right shades and colors correctly follow the pattern of the design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patience resembles other characteristics, but has a unique place in the overall character of the godly man or woman. Bridges describes patience as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a godly reaction to a variety of situations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I consider myself an inpatient person. I get irritated at long grocery store lines; I find myself frustrated by inefficient workers. Yet I know that God calls us to patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Colossians 3:12–13 NIV) Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we are going to be talking about patience in worship. We will be considering James 5:7-10. Remember that we will be gathering in a combined worship service at 10:45 AM (everyone will attend Sunday school at 9:15 AM). The United Choir will be presenting music and two men will be baptized. It will be a special service. I hope you can join us.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we enter the season of Advent, it is a great time to form the habit of spending time in God&amp;rsquo;s Word. I did a quick search last week for Advent devotionals. I found a multitude of resources, but gravitated toward a booklet designed for Advent 2013 by Fresno Pacific University. You can get the devotional &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fresno.edu/adventdevotions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It provides a Scripture to read each day and a brief devotional thought. I hope that you will check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending time in God&amp;rsquo;s Word is crucial. In fact, in this week&amp;rsquo;s text, we are reminded of this truth. Paul highlights the role of God&amp;rsquo;s Word in the life of the believer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Romans 15:4 NIV) For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He describes Scripture as leading us toward unity and providing the necessary power to face the challenges of this world. Do you struggle in your relationship with God? Do you sometimes feel that God is distant? Why don&amp;rsquo;t you try spending more time in God&amp;rsquo;s Word this Advent season. You may find an untapped source of strength. Join us on Sunday as we consider the vital place of God&amp;rsquo;s Word in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the first Sunday of Advent, we consider Paul&amp;rsquo;s words to the Romans. With a sense of urgency, he prompts them to awaken to what God is doing in the world. The time is near and Paul calls us to live in the spiritual day and avoid the traps of the night. As we anticipate the coming of Jesus in Christmas, may we examine our own lives, waking up to what God is doing in the here and now. Romans 13:11–14&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/11/25/Focus</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am really looking forward to this week&amp;rsquo;s sermon. I guess you could say that I am anticipating it. That is what this season is all about. Looking forward with a sense of urgency. A few weeks ago, when I was writing this sermon, I felt that it was particularly relevant in our culture. Paul is urging the Christians at Rome to pay attention to what God is doing in the world. He prods them to live in a way that is intentional, ready for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, during Advent, we will be in the Epistle texts of the lectionary. Three of the sermons will be from the book of Romans. Paul urges Christians in Rome to live in the light as they anticipate all that God is doing. Too often, we are not prepared for God&amp;rsquo;s movement. We are caught up in the busyness of our own lives, especially during the holiday season. This text challenges us to focus, to wake up to God&amp;rsquo;s promptings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you will take a few minutes to read this week&amp;rsquo;s text as you prepare for worship on Sunday. The season of Advent is a special season. May we each prepare appropriately for Christmas as we enter the season together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Romans 13:11–14 NIV) And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this final section of the book of Ruth, we are reminded that this is not an isolated story. Ruth is connected to what God has been doing since the beginning of time. She is connected to what God will eventually do through Jesus. As we study Ruth 4:18–22, we are reminded of our connection with the story. On this Sunday, Wade, Matt and Doug will also answer questions about the overall series.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/11/11/Genealogies</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are closing in on our study of Ruth this week. After this week, we will have one more opportunity to reflect on the story. On Sunday, November 24,
we will gather in a combined service for a dramatic presentation of the story of Ruth. Be sure to bring a side dish and hang around after the service for our annual Harvest Dinner. During this time, we will share about all that God is doing among us at First Baptist. Following the Harvest Dinner, you are also invited to help decorate the church for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sermon format will be a bit different this week. I will briefly discuss the concluding genealogy in the final verses. Doug and Matt will then join me on stage to walk through a few questions about Ruth. Our approach will be conversational. We hope that it will help solidify what we have learned in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often skip over genealogies in Scripture. These are the parts of the Bible that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to read aloud in a small group. Barely pronounceable, the names mean little to us. But there is a reason for genealogies; they teach us an important truth. The story of God spans many generations. We are connected to Ruth, to David, to the prophets. Their lives and our lives are a part of God&amp;rsquo;s story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we explore the final genealogy in Ruth and reflect on the series. I have learned much in this study; I hope you can say the same.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the final scene of the story, God brings redemption to Naomi through the birth of Obed. We must be careful to not romanticize the story.The final scene reminds us that the primary message of the story is one of sacrifice, courage, redemption and rescue. As we reflect on the story, we are challenged to participate in God&amp;rsquo;s plan with the same sort of selfless giving. And as we lay down our own agendas, God creates new life to redeem his people. Ruth 4:13–17&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>A New Baby</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/11/04/A-New-Baby"/>
 		<updated>2013-11-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/11/04/A-New-Baby</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been exciting to see the babies filling the nursery here at First Baptist. Not too many years ago the crib/toddler room was fairly empty. We are now scurrying to find enough volunteers to care for our little ones. This is a wonderful problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babies can certainly be demanding (new parents do not often maintain adequate sleep schedules), but they have a way of bringing light to dark places. In this week&amp;rsquo;s Scripture, we find the prayer of the elders answered. You might remember the city gate prayer,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ruth 4:11 NIV)  May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producing children (particularly sons) was a big deal in the ancient world. Boaz was taking the necessary steps to redeem the line of Elimelech; it would take a son to finalize his work. In two short sentences, we are told that it all works out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ruth 4:13 NIV) So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. Then he went to her, and the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to picture this fairytale ending with Boaz and Ruth riding off into the sunset pushing a baby carriage. But this is not how story ends. Look closely. You might remember that the story began with Naomi; it also ends with Naomi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ruth 4:16–17 NIV) Then Naomi took the child, laid him in her lap and cared for him. The women living there said, “Naomi has a son.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do not say that Ruth and Boaz have a son. The child is considered Naomi&amp;rsquo;s. Join us on Sunday as we explore this dynamic. In the same way that Ruth and Boaz have lived lives of self-sacrifice, this final scene involves more of the same. Their posture challenges our way of living. As we near the end of this story, we will consider the birth of a baby and the implications of his birth for me and you.&lt;/p&gt;

Boaz would need to get legal clearance for this one. In Ruth 4, Boaz gathers the elders at the city gate. He pursues the redemption of Ruth and Naomi, even if it involves financial risk.

 		<title>Tension in the Story</title>

 		<id>/blog/2013/10/28/Tension-in-the-Story</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes a challenge to find a movie that relates to our entire family. With two teenagers, two adults and an eight-year-old, coming up with something that everyone will enjoy is tough. We have to find a riveting story. Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like suspense? A good story always has tension; it is not predictable. If I am able to stay awake through the entire show, it must have an appropriate amount of tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book of Ruth is a good story; and it certainly has its share of tension. As we begin chapter four this week, the story takes another twist. If you have not had a chance to be a part of each sermon, let me encourage you to catch up by watching the videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fbcmuncie.org/video/Tough-Times/&quot;&gt;Week One - Tough Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fbcmuncie.org/video/Permission-or-Forgiveness/&quot;&gt;Week Four - Permission or Forgiveness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left off last week with Boaz&#39; promise to make sure that Ruth has a kinsmen-redeemer. But someone closer in relationship to the family has the legal right to redeem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ruth 3:12 NIV) Although it is true that I am near of kin, there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer than I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our heart sinks; we thought that it was all going to work out. Ruth and Boaz would ride off into the sunset, happily ever after. Things are not going as planned. What is going to happen? Are Naomi and Ruth going to end up in some other guy&amp;rsquo;s home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we explore the legal proceedings of Boaz and the city elders. As the tension of the story keeps up on the edge of our seat, we are assured that God is in the middle of it all. We also discover the selfless posture of Boaz as he brings the case to the elders.&lt;/p&gt;

In chapter 3, Naomi devises plan for Ruth&amp;rsquo;s rescue. Ruth agrees to follow Naomi&amp;rsquo;s plan but steps it up a level by calling on Boaz to act as kinsman-redeemer. The tension of the story builds in this late night interaction between Ruth and Boaz. Ruth 3:1–18&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By no mere coincidence, Ruth finds herself gleaning in the field of Boaz, a kind and charitable relative of Naomi&amp;rsquo;s family. Through their relationship with Boaz, God&amp;rsquo;s provision and grace is made evident in Ruth and Naomi&amp;rsquo;s lives. God has blessed us today through a relationship with his son, Jesus Christ. How may God use relationships in our lives that we may be a blessing to others? Ruth 2:1-23&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>A Commitment of Sacrifice</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/10/07/A-Commitment-of-Sacrifice"/>
 		<updated>2013-10-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/10/07/A-Commitment-of-Sacrifice</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s text (in the book of Ruth) is a familiar text. It is often used in weddings to highlight the commitment between a husband and wife. It probably sounds familiar to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ruth 1:16–17 NIV) Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the context is not always highlighted in weddings, Ruth is making a firm commitment to her mother-in-law. It is worth noting that her decision to relocate with Naomi to Bethlehem offered her little benefit. She was far more likely to find a husband in her homeland. She vows to stick with Naomi at considerable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to read this passage without thinking of Jesus&#39; words of cost and commitment. Certainly, Jesus gave up much to enter our world. Paul tells us that he&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Philippians 2:7–8 NIV) made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death — even death on a cross!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus also calls his followers to the same sort of self-sacrificing posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 10:39 NIV) Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must be careful to highlight the difficulties of Ruth&amp;rsquo;s remaining with Naomi at this point in the story. We cannot skim over this to get on with the story. It is also worth noting that Ruth&amp;rsquo;s following Naomi was linked with her following God. If she returned to Moab, she would likely return to Moabite idol worship. In other words, she follows Naomi, follows God with a posture of sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where sacrifice often depends on benefit, it is hard to wrap our minds around Ruth&amp;rsquo;s willingness to go with Naomi. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t go because she is promised reward. Her love for Naomi propels her relinquishment of her homeland and her way of life. I am reminded of Jesus&#39; words,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Mark 10:29–31 NIV) “I tell you the truth,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields — and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we consider this part of the story, may we be challenged to give selflessly. May Ruth&amp;rsquo;s love (agape) for Naomi prompt us to lay our lives down for God.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the next several weeks, we will be studying the book of Ruth. In the first few verses of this book, we find tremendous suffering. For Naomi, life is not good. She suffers famine, relocation, disappointment, barrenness in her family and the death of her children. To make matters worse, she is now on the brink of poverty as a widow with no support. The story of Ruth begins in a desperate place. Ruth 1:1-5&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/09/30/Noonday-Devil</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was getting ready to write my blog entry for the week and received an email from Jim Hiatt. I thought that his comments fit perfectly into what we are talking about on Sunday. He was sharing about a variety of references to &amp;ldquo;noonday devil&amp;rdquo; in songs. He wondered what this was all about. After researching, he discovered that this phrase had its origins in desert monasticism. It was the noon day that was the most difficult to pray.The monk would question his calling, wonder if it was worth it to pray. He would be prone to despair in the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Ruth and Naomi find themselves fighting the &amp;ldquo;noonday devil&amp;rdquo; in this week&amp;rsquo;s text. Life has dealt them difficult circumstances. Many scholars liken Naomi to a female Job. Her life is falling apart; despair and grief mark her days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we&amp;rsquo;re going to begin the story of Ruth. In the first five verses, the scene is described. From famine to relocation, from barrenness to widowhood, Naomi&amp;rsquo;s life takes a plunge. As we consider her suffering, it prompts us to consider our own suffering. For many, life has not been ideal. How do we respond? As we consider this text, we find that lament is a natural and often necessary part of life. How do we fight the &amp;ldquo;noonday devil&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/09/23/Tychicus-</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the final words of Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Ephesians, he makes mention of this guy named Tychicus. Tychicus is his carrier. He is also mentioned in Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Colossians 4:7–8 NIV) Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord. I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to write a letter; it&amp;rsquo;s another thing to send someone who is able to relate personal experience. Since the week following Easter, we have been working through the book of Ephesians. We have been studying this Scripture together each week. I find it interesting that Tychicus is mentioned in Paul&amp;rsquo;s closing. We are clued into the fact that there is more to the story that is not written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 6:21–22 NIV) Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing. I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you wish we could find out more? Don&amp;rsquo;t you wish that we had access to Tychicus&#39; Facebook feed? Paul understood that relating personal experience is extremely powerful. He did not simply send a letter; he sent a letter and a messenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sunday, we are going to be sharing our personal experience with the book of Ephesians. We have four testimonies about interacting with the book of Ephesians. While Paul&amp;rsquo;s words are powerful and cannot be replaced with our own, it is also important to share our experience. Just as Tychicus related Paul&amp;rsquo;s story, some of you are going to relate your story. Join us on Sunday for an abbreviated sermon and four testimonies about our study in Ephesians.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I meet with a group of pastors once a month for sharing and prayer. This past month, we met in our church office. It happened to be the same day that I was working on this week&amp;rsquo;s sermon. As we went around the room, I kept hearing one word; it was the word &lt;em&gt;attacked&lt;/em&gt;. Pastors were sharing about ways in which they felt attacked by the evil one. There seemed to be a disproportionate amount of pressure on the families of the pastors, as well as the pastors themselves. A few hours later, I began working on this sermon. I read,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 6:10–11 NIV) Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul reminds us that we are in a battle. The evil one truly attacks. He comes after us. Paul continues,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 6:12 NIV) For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul describes rulers and authorities, powers of the dark world. He tells us that they are working against us, against the Kingdom of God. On Sunday, we are going to explore this text. We are going to talk about what it means to put on the armor of God. In a world where a few of us have participated in authentic battle, we may have a hard time grasping this imagery. At the same time, as we explore the battle equipment of the Roman soldier, it sheds light on Paul&amp;rsquo;s intentions in this text. Paul wants us to be prepared, to be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, we failed to understand what is going on around us. We are ill-equipped for the attacks that come our way. May we learn to make provision for the evil around us. May we raise our awareness of the cosmic powers intent on our destruction. May we wear the armor provided for us by the work of Jesus so that we can defeat the adversary. Join us on Sunday as we explore this text.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Paul&amp;rsquo;s practical application of his admonition &amp;ldquo;be careful how you live&amp;rdquo; plays itself out in our relationships. Last week, we talked about the relationship of the husband and a wife. This week, we talk about parents and children, masters and slaves. While it is difficult to appreciate authority figures in our lives, God calls us to honor, respect, even though obey them. We are to serve them as we serve Christ. Ephesians 6:1-9&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Authority Figures</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/09/11/authority-figures"/>
 		<updated>2013-09-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/09/11/authority-figures</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;authority&lt;/em&gt; raises all sorts of emotions. From the freedom-hungry teen to the disgruntled worker, it is natural to resist those in charge. It is easy to build a case for rebellion. Perhaps we have been unfairly treated or misunderstood; either way we often push against those in a position of authority. Yet in today&amp;rsquo;s text, Paul calls us to submit to authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, we discovered that Christian marriage is a relationship of submission. The wife is called to submit to the husband; the husband is called to love (give his very life) for his wife. This week, we focus on the parent/child, slave/master relationships. Right away, this text raises the question of slavery. Why did Paul not speak out against this atrocity? Does he seem to condone slavery? Without going into too much detail, it is worth noting that Paul&amp;rsquo;s understanding of slavery is a radical departure from his culture&amp;rsquo;s understanding. Some have even credited Christians with the abolition of slavery. Yet in this text, Paul is simply addressing the reality of first century culture. Slaves comprised about one third of the population in the Roman empire. They were considered a part of the family unit. Therefore, it is appropriate to address them along with parent/child relationships in Ephesians 6:1-9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul begins by addressing children. He calls them to obedience in relationship to their parents. Following Old Testament guidelines, Paul highlights the appropriateness of children obeying parents. At the same time, he calls parents to instruct their children rather than provoke them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 6:4 NIV) Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is responsibility on both sides. Children must obey; parents must train. In the same way, Paul calls slaves to live lives of submission to their masters. And masters are also admonished toward submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 6:9 NIV) And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those placed an authority have responsibility under God. It is clear, in this text, those under authority and those in authority must live lives of submission. Both must place themselves under the authority of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on this text, we admit our reluctance to submit to authority. It has become stylish in our culture to reject authority. Yet God calls us to place ourselves in the posture of obedience and submission. We must respect those that God has placed over us. Whether they are parents, coaches, teachers, professors or bosses, we must see their authority as God-given. And as we acknowledge and respect their authority, we are living in obedience to God. Join us on Sunday as we explore Ephesians 6:1-9. May we be challenged to appropriately respond to the authorities in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marriage is certainly a hot topic word in today&amp;rsquo;s culture. From issues of sexual orientation to a degrading understanding of commitment, we are faced with an ever changing understanding of what it means to be married. As Paul addressed the church at Ephesus, he understood the importance of Christians living in healthy marriages. For the next couple of weeks, our text deals with practical matters of family relationships. As you might remember, Paul wanted Christians to be careful in the way they live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:15 NIV) Be very careful, then, how you live&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we live in marriage is crucial and merits Paul&amp;rsquo;s attention. He offers instructions to both husbands and wives. He draws an analogy between the husband/wife relationship and the Christ/Church relationship. We will explore the specifics on Sunday (I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spoil the sermon). But for now, let me highlight the importance of healthy marriages. Paul quotes Genesis 2,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:31 NIV) “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One body. One flesh. Marriages are a serious joining of two people. How can we make sure they remain strong, in tact? Paul, in Ephesians 5, give us guidance in this endeavor. He calls both the husband and wife toward a selfless posture of sacrifice. I hope you will join us on Sunday as we explore Paul&amp;rsquo;s instructions to husbands and wives.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Ephesians, he insists that their lives be different.

He also describes the essential dynamic of living in community with one another. As we study this passage, may we learn to live as God desires.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/08/26/Careful-Living</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was eating lunch today at the student center at Ball State. College students are back and the place was buzzing. My friend and I were talking about the hectic schedules that everyone seems to have. While technology allows us to accomplish, with a button press, what took our ancestors hours to complete, our lives are busier than ever. We mindlessly run from one activity to the other. Paul&amp;rsquo;s admonition in this week&amp;rsquo;s text is particularly relevant in our culture. He tells us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:15 NIV) Be very careful, then, how you live &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of us have trouble just getting through the day, Paul calls us to a higher level of intentionality. The word that is translated &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; in the text is the Greek word &lt;em&gt;peripateo&lt;/em&gt;. It is often translated as &lt;em&gt;walk&lt;/em&gt;. We have this image of carefully walking through life. In this text, Paul details at least three ways that we are to walk, live. I will save this for Sunday. For now, let me focus on one other word in the text. Paul also tells us to live&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:16 NIV) making the most of every opportunity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;opportunity&lt;/em&gt; is an interesting word; it is sometimes translated as &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;. There are at least two words in the Greek that we translate as &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;. The first is &lt;em&gt;chronos&lt;/em&gt;. As you might imagine, it has to do with chronological time. But another word describes significant moments in time; it is the word &lt;em&gt;kairos&lt;/em&gt;. These moments are less about chronology and more about significance. You probably remember moments like these, the birth of your first child or your first date. Yet if we slow down enough, we might discover these moments each and every day. This is what Paul is saying. We should be careful how we live, making the most of those &lt;em&gt;kairos&lt;/em&gt; moments in our lives. These are the moments of significance, moments when God speaks, moves, acts. He goes on to describe living life filled with the Spirit. Again, Paul&amp;rsquo;s expectation is that each day would consist of what we might call &amp;ldquo;God moments&amp;rdquo;. And we should be careful, paying attention and living in these moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we explore this Scripture. I am excited to study it with you. In our hurried world, it is particularly powerful. Ephesians 5:15-21.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/08/19/Youth-Sunday</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This Sunday, we will be taking a break from the Ephesians series. Youth from the Muncie Area Youth for Christ are holding a retreat in our building.They will be attending late worship hour. We have decided to join them in their study of 1 John 2:3-6. We will be hearing from our teens in both services (including teens sharing about their summer mission experience at Camp Barnabas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, this is a challenging text. John connects our knowing Jesus with obedience. He tells us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 John 2:3 NIV)  We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He expands this statement by calling out those who claim to know Jesus yet fail to obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 John 2:4 NIV) The man who says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty strong language, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you agree? Those who claim relationship with Jesus, but do not heed His commands, do not truly belong to Him. He continues to explain,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 John 2:5–6 NIV) But if anyone obeys his word, God’s love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word that is translated &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; in the text is sometimes translated as &lt;em&gt;finish&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; in other places. What does it mean for God&amp;rsquo;s love to be made complete in us? Paul uses this word in his letters several times. He uses the language of an athelete finishing a competition or race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will explore this text on Sunday. We will talk about the connection between relationship and obedience. Our youth will share about their experience of walking as Jesus walked. They have found freedom in obedience (two words that often seem contrary). Plan to join us on Sunday as we explore this text and hear from our teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Ephesians 5:8-14, Paul summons us to live lives of light. He describes our being transferred from darkness into light. Exposing the darkness of our world is our calling. We are called to avoid darkness and make visable the light of God as we live lives that please Him.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Light Exposes</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/08/12/Light-Exposes"/>
 		<updated>2013-08-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/08/12/Light-Exposes</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, images of light and darkness have been used to describe good and bad. From evil villains to angelic beings, we have associated the images of light (white) and darkness (black) with opposing sides. Yet in this week&amp;rsquo;s text, we see another dimension of this image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul describes what we (Christians) have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:8 NIV)  For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have heard this before. Throughout Scripture, we are told that God is light and the evil one is dark. As God&amp;rsquo;s children, we are brought into the light. But there is more to this description. Paul describes light as having the power to expose darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:13–14 NIV) But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for it is light that makes everything visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is dark evil, but it is in the business of hiding truth. Can you think of the hidden aspects of evil in our world? From lies about our sexuality to mistruths regarding the fulfillment of material goods, we are often tricked by evil. For example, what is described as casual sex is anything but casual. God&amp;rsquo;s design for sexuality cannot be reduced to a physical act. Partners are left with emotional baggage and scars that last a lifetime. Or consider those who are hoodwinked into believing that our lives consist of possessions. Millionaires find lives void of meaning and substance. They are left wondering if there is more to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul tells us that light exposes darkness. In other words, God&amp;rsquo;s truth has the power to reveal the lies of the evil one. Join us on Sunday as we discuss the ramifications of living lives of light. May we be challenged to brighten the dark places of our world with the light of God.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it is often difficult when the ways of God are in contrast to the ways of the world. Paul warns us to take this admonition seriously. In fact, those who continue to live in immorality, impurity, greed will not inherit the kingdom of God. We are warned of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath for those who continue in ways contrary to his nature.

 		<link href="/blog/2013/08/05/Struck-Down"/>
 		<updated>2013-08-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/08/05/Struck-Down</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s title slide is ominous. The words &lt;em&gt;The Wrath of God&lt;/em&gt; are floating between storm clouds. There are even lighting strikes that seem to be landing on parts of the lettering. If you saw this slide, you might expect to see a red-faced preacher banging on a pulpit. Have you ever experienced a preacher like this? We form this idea of God waiting to strike us down the next time we mess up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reacting against such behavior, others have portrayed God as a loving grandparent. Love, forgiveness, grace and mercy overshadow any inclinations of judgment and wrath. This sort of God winks at sin and seems to be happy, as long as we visit Him every week. So which one is it? What kind of God do we serve? A God of wrath or forgiveness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find both images of God in Scripture. God is loving, forgiving. In fact, he loves us so much that he gave His only Son for us (John 3:16). We don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose sight of this. At the same time, we find passages describing God&amp;rsquo;s wrath falling on those who reject His commands. But when we talk about God&amp;rsquo;s judgment or wrath, we get uncomfortable. We live in a non-judgmental world in which we are taught to tolerate. God&amp;rsquo;s wrath does not fit our worldview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s passage, we read,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:5–7 NIV) For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person — such a man is an idolater — has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul is confident that those who live in old clothes (to borrow from our Ephesians series image) will not be a part of the Kingdom of God. In fact, he is sure that they will experience the wrath of God. What does this mean? How do we reconcile this statement with our understanding of a loving God? Join us on Sunday as we explore Ephesians 5:5-7.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As Paul continues to describe the new clothes of the Christians, he touches on a topic that is often taken lightly in our culture. We flippantly dismiss obsenity as harmless or innocent. Paul calls Christians to the high standard of purity in contrast to obscenity. As Peter reminds us, we are called to be a holy people in the same way that God is holy. Sometimes the standard seems impossibly high. Yet Paul reminds us that even the slightest hint of impurity is dangerous. Ephesians 5:3-4&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/07/29/No-Trace</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week is our last week in our &lt;em&gt;New Clothes&lt;/em&gt; series. I have enjoyed delving deeper into this part of Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Ephesians. His words have challenged our actions and our attitudes. In this last sermon, we are going to be exploring a familiar description of avoidable actions (sexual immorality, impurity and greed). Yet Paul&amp;rsquo;s language is strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:3 NIV) But among you there must not be even a hint of &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No trace should be present in the lives of a Christian. Then in verse 4, Paul clarifies this admonition. In this verse, we see a rare dynamic. Paul uses three words that are used nowhere else in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:4 NIV) Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three words are obscenity (some translate filthiness), foolish talk (we get the word &lt;em&gt;moron&lt;/em&gt; from this Greek word) and course (or vulgar) joking. While it may seem obvious that obscenity does not belong in the life of a Christian, how many of us are guilty of laughing at a vulgar joke? Paul raising the standard in this verse. Not only are we to refrain from sexual immorality, our new clothes involve a rejection of anything impure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul describes our role as a holy people, set apart. We will explore Peter&amp;rsquo;s understanding of this dynamic on Sunday. I have to admit, this is a challenging text. In a culture where obscenity is the norm, our new clothes may look out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we finish this mini series about shedding the old and putting on the new. Ephesians 5:1-3.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/07/22/Heart-Change</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have found this &lt;em&gt;New Clothes&lt;/em&gt; series to be both practical and challenging. This week, we come to our fifth sermon in this series. It is perhaps the most challenging of all. While Paul has encouraged us to work with our hands and watch our mouths in the last few texts, he summons our hearts in this week&amp;rsquo;s text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ephesians 4:31, he admonishes us to rid ourselves of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:31 NIV) all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the earlier counsel had to do with action (working with our hands, controlling our words), Paul bids a deeper examination. Things like bitterness and anger have to do with the heart. In fact, we see the word &lt;em&gt;bitterness&lt;/em&gt; throughout Scripture as describing those who have rejected God. In Acts 8, Peter rebukes Simon because he wants to purchase the power of God. He tells him,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Acts 8:21 NIV) because your heart is not right before God &amp;hellip; For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Paul (in this week&amp;rsquo;s text) advises us to,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:32 NIV) Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and also to,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:1 NIV) Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main verb (to be) describes something deeper. Paul not only wants us to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, but he also wants us to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;. Our new clothes in Christ make their way into our inner being. On Sunday, we are going to unpack this. We&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about a heart change that needs to happen as a part of our new clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is sometimes easier to take action than to consider our heart condition. But in the end, any action that does not address heart change is temporary. So Paul extends his admonition. He calls us, not only to action, but to transformation. Join us on Sunday as we talk about the necessity of heart change as a part of our new wardrobe in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As Paul continues to explain what life in Christ looks like, he focuses on the words of our mouth. We are encouraged to be careful about what we say. Our words have tremendous power. They can hurt or heal, damage or build up. Our new clothes include careful consideration about what we say. Ephesians 4:29-30&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been influenced by someone&amp;rsquo;s words? Where they good or bad words? Did they make a powerful impact or did they cut through you like a knife? No doubt, words are powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continue our series about putting on new clothes, our discussion turns toward our words, our mouths. We are instructed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:29 NIV) Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we will explore this text. As we learn to live in our new clothes, we are challenged to carefully consider our words. You might remember, James told us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(James 3:3–6 NIV) When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we often let our words fly without much thought, we are reminded of the incredible power we hold in our words. Join us on Sunday as we explore this text.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we continue our mini series (New Clothes) in Ephesians 4:28, Paul insists that we stop stealing in order to give.

 		<title>Getting Tired</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/07/08/Getting-Tired"/>
 		<updated>2013-07-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/07/08/Getting-Tired</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, Roger Morency and I are in Missouri with eight teenagers. They are serving disabled kids each day as camp counselors. Their work is not easy. You can see the exhausted look on their faces each evening as the day comes to a close. Some counselors work through the night helping their campers find comfort away from home. Their only break is a one-hour rest after lunch; the campers are supervised by staff so that he counselors can recoup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this week&amp;rsquo;s sermon has to do with work. As we continue our series on new clothes, Paul turns his attention to the practical matter of stealing and giving. He writes in verse 28,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:28 NIV) He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, this seems like a no-brainer. Most in society would agree that stealing is wrong. Taking what belongs to someone else is the easy way. In contrast, Paul admonishes Christians to work. Paul writes similar admonitions to the Corinthians and the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 Corinthians 4:12 NIV) We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 Thessalonians 4:11 NIV) Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greek word that is translated &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; literally means to &lt;em&gt;grow tired or weary&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, Paul is telling us to get tired. We often avoid work. We attempt to find the easiest way to get by. Yet we are called, as Christians, to expend our energy so that we will be able to give. Stealing is about getting. Work is about giving. On Sunday, we will unpack this idea. We will hear testimony from our teenagers during the sermon. As they have worked this week, they have found it to be a spiritual experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new clothes in Christ involve work. While this may not sound like fun, we discover that work contributes to healthy spirituality. As our bodies grow tired, we find joy in giving up. We model Jesus as we work, offering ourselves for God&amp;rsquo;s glory. As we prepare to worship on Sunday, allow me to share Eugene Peterson&amp;rsquo;s rendering of Romans 12:1-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you: Take your everyday, ordinary life &amp;ndash; your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life &amp;ndash; and place it before God as an offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/06/17/Truth-Bearers</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week in worship, we talked about wearing new clothes. We are not talking about the latest fashion trends or the need to recreate our wardrobe. We are discussing the spiritual clothing of God-followers. Paul instructs us (in his letter to the Ephesians),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:22–24 NIV) to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this look like? What sorts of spiritual threads are we to wear? Over the next several weeks, we are going to specifically examine the fabric of our clothing. This week, we will be looking at one verse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:25 NIV) Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems pretty fundamental, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this one of the ten commandments (the main rules)? We also read in a number of places of God as truth. We read in the Old Testament,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Numbers 23:19 NIV) God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the author of Hebrews reminds us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Hebrews 6:18 NIV) it is impossible for God to lie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt as children of God, we are to model truth. Yet we live in a world that often confuses truth and falsehood. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish the two. We (Christians) occasionally muddy the waters. We are not always honest with each other, sporadically choosing diplomatic tones over truth. Join us on Sunday as we explore the multi-faceted nature of truth telling. We are called by God to proclaim truth in every dimension of life.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Ernest T. Bass</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/06/10/Ernest-T.-Bass"/>
 		<updated>2013-06-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/06/10/Ernest-T.-Bass</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I grew up watching the Andy Griffith Show. While my favorite character was Barney Fife, one of the most remembered characters was Ernest T. Bass. Ernest T. was an uneducated and disorderly mountain man who often caused trouble in the town of Mayberry. While he only appeared in six episodes, he made his mark on the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite episodes is a 1964 episode entitled &lt;em&gt;My Fair Ernest T. Bass&lt;/em&gt;. On a Mayberry wiki site, the episode is described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy tries to make a silk purse out of a sow&amp;rsquo;s ear when he takes it upon himself to turn Ernest T. into a presentable gentleman. The big test comes at Mrs. Wiley&amp;rsquo;s weekly reception when Andy tries to pass him off as his cousin Oliver &amp;ldquo;Ollie&amp;rdquo; Gossage. Even Andy is surprised at Ernest T.&amp;rsquo;s progress when Mrs. Wiley places his accent as being definitely Back Bay Bostonian, but the whole scheme blows up when Bass smashes a vase over the head of a man who won&amp;rsquo;t allow him to cut in for a dance with his chosen woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you remember the famous phrase, &amp;ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Wiley&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztrLMXY_9TA&quot;&gt;Watch clip here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Earnest T. changes clothes. He is unable to tranform. He quickly returns to his original self when he patience is tested. Renewal must begin on the inside and work its way out. In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Paul urges Christians in Ephesus to put on new clothes. He is not suggesting a cover-up operation. Instead, he wants them to live into the authentic transformation, change that has already taken place. While new clothes do not always produce change, remaining in old clothes can hinder. He urges,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:22–24 NIV) put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives should look different when we are in Christ. We must do away with the old and put on the new. It must more than a nice haircut, bath and brief etiquette training. It didn&amp;rsquo;t work for Ernest T; it will not work for us. Rather our inner renewal begins in our hearts and becomes evident in the way we live. For the next several weeks, we will unpack this idea of wearing new clothes. Join us on Sunday as we kick off this mini series (inside our Ephesians series) entitled &lt;em&gt;New Clothes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Paul desires growth for the church at Ephesus. He compares the church with an anatomical body. While we all begin as infants, we grow through childhood, into adolescence toward adulthood. It is only natural that we would reach maturity. He expects the same for the church. As the church develops, he imagines them developing into the fully functioning body of Christ. Ephesians 4:13–16&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>The Big Kids Table</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/06/03/The-Big-Kids-Table"/>
 		<updated>2013-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/06/03/The-Big-Kids-Table</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the little kids table? At family gatherings, we always had an adult table and a little kids table. There were always a few awkward years when you had to remain at the little kids table. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was a matter of chair distribution or helping younger siblings feel included. Either way, we all like to graduate up. Elementary years are the worst. You&amp;rsquo;re a bit too old for the little kid toys (although you may still like them), but you are not yet ready for the big kid toys. We finally navigate to a stable place. We grow up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up is a natural part of life. It seems strange when we stagnate. Breast feeding four-year olds or bottle carrying six year olds cause us to wonder if parents are doing their job. Why aren&amp;rsquo;t they moving on? Why aren&amp;rsquo;t they growing up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Paul pictures a mature church. He describes the dangers of remaining in spiritual childhood. An infant church is vulnerable, blown by the winds of false teachers. It is a dangerous place to be. Yet Paul pictures the church at Ephesus as grown up. He describes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:16 NIV) From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is natural to physically grow. At the same time, it is normal to grow spiritually. In fact, something is wrong if this does not happen. And when we are mature, every part of the body works together. It functions in a healthy way. As we consider this text on Sunday, may we be challenged to grow up. May we be dissatisfied to remain as spiritual infants, longing to sit at the big kids table.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Measuring Out</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/05/27/Measuring-Out"/>
 		<updated>2013-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/05/27/Measuring-Out</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A highlight of our Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day season is going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loweryscandies.com/&quot;&gt;Lowery&amp;rsquo;s candies&lt;/a&gt;. This year, we arrived early in the day. We hoped to avoid the crowd; still the line reached outside the building. When you purchase candy from Lowery&amp;rsquo;s, they place the selections on a small scale. The confections are measured out and you pay by weight. If there is too little on the scale, you get to pick out an additional piece. If it is too heavy &amp;hellip; maybe you will have a nice attendant that will overlook the overage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Paul describes the church (each one of us) receiving gifts (charis). Our gifts are distributed by Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:7 NIV) But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word translated &lt;em&gt;apportioned&lt;/em&gt; describes a measuring out. In fact, the KJV translates it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:7 KJV) according to the measure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image of a storekeeper and a scale dominates the readers mind. Jesus is passing out as He determines. Last week we focused on the unity of the church, this week&amp;rsquo;s text highlights variety. We are all given distinct gifts. While one of us may be strong in a particular area, he may prove deficient in another. At the same time, another one of us is able to pick up what is lacking from his fellow church member. Jesus does not pass out gifts in an assembly line fashion. He carefully measures and distributes in His wisdom. In turn, we are called to utilize these gifts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:12 NIV) to prepare God’s people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are we handling our gifts? Are we unhappy with our allotment? Are we failing to utilize our gifts? Is the body of Christ suffering because of our failure to act on what has been given to us? As we explore Ephesians 4:7-12 on Sunday, we are each challenged to acknowledge the source of our gifts and employ them in His church.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>More Than Putting Up</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/05/20/More-Than-Putting-Up"/>
 		<updated>2013-05-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/05/20/More-Than-Putting-Up</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you always get along with everyone in your family? Do you sometimes have disagreements? How do you handle them? Some families encounter deep disputes that divide, break relationships. I know of some people who have not talked to siblings in years because of a diffence of opinion. While some families cherish time with one another, others learn to peacefully co-exist. Yet all of us would admit that relationships take effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Paul urges the church to action. He calls for a posture of humilty, patience and love. Paul says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:2 NIV) Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One verb sticks out in this text. The verb &lt;em&gt;anechomenoi&lt;/em&gt; is translated as &lt;em&gt;bearing with&lt;/em&gt; in this verse. In other places, it is rendered as &lt;em&gt;put up with&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;endure&lt;/em&gt;. Can you believe this? Paul admits that life in the church is not always friendly and enjoyable. He is suggesting that we do not always like each other, agree with one another and take pleasure in one another. Sometimes the best we can do is &lt;em&gt;put up with&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;endure&lt;/em&gt; one another. While this seems less than ideal, most of us can relate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that we need to find ways to share our building without fighting? Should we learn to politely pass one another in the hallway with friendly words? I think Paul wants more. He continues,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 4:3 NIV) Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must take it a step further. The phrase &lt;em&gt;make every effort&lt;/em&gt; is often stated as &lt;em&gt;do your best&lt;/em&gt;. We are challenged to do everything in our power to reconcile and maintain bonds with one another. On Sunday, we will be summoned to action in our unity. I sense that God is prompting us to move in this direction. Maybe this summer, each of us could use the relaxed church schedule to pursue stronger relationships with each other. Join us on Sunday as we explore Ephesians 4:1–6.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 1985,  Huey Lewis and the News released a single entitled &lt;em&gt;The Power of Love&lt;/em&gt;. It was written for and featured in the 1985 blockbuster film &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt;. The song gave the band their first number-one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The lyrics proclaim,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need money, don&amp;rsquo;t take fame
Don&amp;rsquo;t need no credit card to ride this train
It&amp;rsquo;s strong and it&amp;rsquo;s sudden and it&amp;rsquo;s cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That&amp;rsquo;s the power of love&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that love has power; yet I assume that Huey Lewis and the News are referring to romantic love. While romantic love is forceful, the love of God has greater potential for transformation. In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Paul offers a prayer for the church. His prayer includes the hope that the church will fully experience God&amp;rsquo;s love and in turn be firmly rooted and established. Take a look at what Paul is asking,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 3:17–19 NIV) And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge — that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While Huey Lewis and the News acknowledge the strength of love; they also understand the mystery involved. They can only describe it as &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sudden&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cruel&amp;rdquo; at times. Paul also labels love as unexplainable. Yet he longs for the church to experience it. He wants them to grasp it. This is an interesting word in Greek. While the word is used 15 times in the NT, it is rarely translated the same in English (it is translated in 14 different ways). Just take a look at the ways it is rendered in English (caught, found, obtained, surprised, overtake). Love is not understood; it is only experienced. It cannot be explained; we can only be caught up in it. And as when we encounter it, it transforms us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; May we somehow meet the love of God. May we discover its insurmountable width and length and height and depth. May it fill us and spill out of us as we relate to our world. Maybe Huey Lewis and the News should have turned to Ephesians 3 as they composed this song. Perhaps they would find inspiration for an additional verse.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In prison, Paul relates to the churches in Asia minor his purpose in life. He has been called by God to unveil a mystery. This mystery has been unknown to previous generations. Now, God has revealed His plan through the work of His Son, Jesus. And because of this work, we now have confident access to Him. Ephesians 3:1-12&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we spent some time in Savannah, Georgia. The historic city was welcoming spring with flowers blooming and trees budding. While the city is filled with landmarks, one of the most popular tours is the ghost tour. Tourists travel in a convertible hearse. If you ask me, that alone is a bit creepy. Why are such excursions popular? It seems that mystery lures. From Sherlock Holmes to Alfred Hitchcock, we are drawn to the unknown. And who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a good mystery solved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Paul describes his life&amp;rsquo;s purpose as unveiling the mystery of God. For thousands of years, God&amp;rsquo;s purposes were concealed. A chosen few were able to gain glimpses of God&amp;rsquo;s movement, but His master plan was hidden. He describes it as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 3:4-5 NIV) the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to men in other generations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet now things are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 3:5 NIV) it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul considers himself chosen by God to deliver the news (good news, gospel, &lt;em&gt;euaggelon&lt;/em&gt;). While he considers the gospel (good news) unsearchable, untraceable, he envisions his life as bringing clarity to mystery of God. So what has been unveiled? What aspects of God&amp;rsquo;s work have been brought to light? The crux of the news is spelled out in verse 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 3:12 NIV) In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is astonishing. The work of God through Christ has given us unexplainable admission into God&amp;rsquo;s presence. God&amp;rsquo;s plan is now revealed. May we rejoice in the mystery unveiled. Join us on Sunday as we explore Ephesians 3:1-12 together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Paul remind us that we were want separated from God, excluded from the family. Yet through the blood of Jesus, we are invited as members of God&amp;rsquo;s household. In Ephesians 2:11-22, Paul urges us toward unity. He uses a variety of images to prompt us toward reconcilation so that we can become God&amp;rsquo;s dwelling on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/04/23/Not-My-Words</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoy preaching Lectionary passages. The chosen texts allow us to experience various parts of God&amp;rsquo;s Word. We are challenged to journey through the church seasons along with the rest of the world (all who follow the church calendar). Yet I also enjoy preaching through books of the Bible. The week to week consistency of remaining in one book allows us to build on the previous weeks. We are able to experience the totality of the book; we encounter the whole of the author&amp;rsquo;s writing. As we make our way through Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Ephesians, I find his words extremely relevant to us. While Paul is writing to a church nearly 2000 years ago, his words strike a chord with us, First Baptist Muncie. His prayer highlights our calling as a church. His admonitions paint a picture of a healthy congregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no secret; we are transitioning as a congregation. The dynamics of how we operate are shifting. Our culture is drastically changing. Non-profits across the country are learning to live on less. We are trying to figure out what this means for us. New people are joining our church family. Our congregational makeup looks a bit different than just a few years ago. While we are saying goodbye to long time members, we are also welcoming young families; the nursery is nearly to capacity most weeks. For the first time in several years, we are able to field a softball team. How might these changes impact us? How can we remain on track with God&amp;rsquo;s purposes for us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to have all the answers. Our cultural and congregational shifts are complex and challenging. Yet I am sure God will lead us. A crucial element of our seeking God is our study of Scripture. As we move through Ephesians together, I am astounded by the pertinence of each text to our congregational life. I am reminded of Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 Thessalonians 2:13 NIV) And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thessalonians viewed Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter as divine. They submitted to it; they allowed it to transform them. In the same way, we must allow God&amp;rsquo;s Word to lead us, direct us. As we gather each week, we come with open ears and open hearts to God&amp;rsquo;s Word. Scripture will do its work in us as we navigate necessary changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am comforted by this. My words are incomplete; I need a compass to traverse the current landscape. God&amp;rsquo;s Word points us in the directions we need to go. I am looking forward to engaging Scripture with you each week. I am with you in this; together we will submit to Scripture as it encourages, prompts, guides us into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Division</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/04/22/Division"/>
 		<updated>2013-04-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/04/22/Division</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ephesians has proven to be a rich study. Paul paints a picture of a healthy church. He describes life &lt;em&gt;in Christ&lt;/em&gt; as a beautiful joining of a redeemed people. In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, we are summoned to consider the ramifications of division in the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At First Baptist Muncie, we have struggled with this issue. We understand the implications of church division. It nearly destroyed our church several years ago. Yet, unification is not easy. Personal preferences, age differences and generational values often create barriers for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ephesians 2, Paul outlines Jesus&#39; work as unifying work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 2:14 NIV) For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to establish peace, to break down dividing walls. His work on the Cross merged disparate groups into one body (Jews and Gentiles). While Paul was primarily concerned with deep divisions in these groups, his words are also relevant to us. Paul describes our joining together into one household, one building. I love these images. They remind us of the necessity of working together. Families (households) that work against one another have a hard time functioning. Buildings with competing materials are bound to crumble. It just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Households and buildings must hold together to remain strong. This is how Paul describes the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 2:21–22 NIV) In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One God &amp;hellip; One Spirit &amp;hellip; One Family &amp;hellip; One Building joined together as a dwelling for God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit. We are all on the same team; our interests cannot compete if we want to survive. This may be easier said than done; yet we must take this admonition seriously. Join us on Sunday as we explore the significance of this text.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Master Craftsman</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/04/15/Master-Craftsman"/>
 		<updated>2013-04-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/04/15/Master-Craftsman</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I spent a day studying for this Sunday&amp;rsquo;s sermon. When I finished the work, I noticed that the sermon was much shorter than usual. I considered reviewing the text to add depth. However, I decided to leave the space open. Maybe the Spirit has other things planned for April 21. As you will experience on Sunday, the sermon uses several visual illustrations. I&amp;rsquo;ll not spoil the surprise. Just a few days after my sermon work, someone asked to share a testimony. The content of their sharing ties in perfectly with the text. Certainly, God had more in mind for this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we move into the second chapter of Ephesians, we find a description of our pre-Christ state. Paul describes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 2:1 NIV) As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine ourselves as dead. We often take a less drastic view of our condition. Yet when we get to the end of this text, our lifeless state makes sense. God uses us when we have nothing to offer. He utilizes the raw material of our lives to produce incredible works. Paul reminds us of our passive contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 2:8–9 NIV) For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith — and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God — not by works, so that no one can boast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the kicker. We become God&amp;rsquo;s craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 2:10 NIV) For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaiah speaks in similar terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Isaiah 64:6–7 NIV) All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away. No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away because of our sins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds pessimistic, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Sounds like a fairly gloomy understanding. However, Isaiah continues,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Isaiah 64:8 NIV) Yet, O LORD, you are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God takes our unclean, leaf-like, unrefined, dare I say &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt; existence. He turns out incredible peices of work. We sometimes feel the pressure of having to measure up. The expectation to produce weighs us down. Jesus once said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 11:30 NIV) For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking with God is less about production, more about submission. Dependance is far more important than output. In fact, the works that God desires are His works, in and through us. May we allow God to engineer our lives. May we release ourselves to Him. May we experience God&amp;rsquo;s great works in us as we submit ourselves to the Master craftsman.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Eyes of Our Heart</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/04/08/Eyes-of-Our-Heart"/>

 		<id>/blog/2013/04/08/Eyes-of-Our-Heart</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, we talked about the core of our worship. Our redemption in Jesus is at the heart of our worship. Yet the result of our worship is different. We have been redeemed (although the full effect of our redemption is our being glorified with Christ); it is something that has taken place in the past. In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Paul focuses on the effect of our worship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we hope to experience as we worship? Paul prays that we would know Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 1:17 NIV) I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to know about Jesus. It is another to know Him. Paul wants, for the church, more than intellectual knowledge of Jesus. He desires that we fully experience living in relationship with Him. He describes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 1:18 NIV) I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three Greek words in this verse that are worth highlighting. The first is translated &lt;em&gt;eyes&lt;/em&gt; (ophthalmos). The second is translated &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt; (kardia). The third is translated &lt;em&gt;enlightened&lt;/em&gt; (photizo). In the ancient world, the heart was seen as the center of one&amp;rsquo;s being. We might use the word &lt;em&gt;mind&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt; in today&amp;rsquo;s language. We don&amp;rsquo;t think of our inner being having eyes. Yet Paul is praying for clarity in our heart (our inmost being); he wants us to comprehend God. And what does he want for the &lt;em&gt;eyes of our heart&lt;/em&gt;? He wants them to be enlightened. Notice the Greek word, &lt;em&gt;photizo&lt;/em&gt;. It is the root word for photograph or photo. In other words, Paul wants us to be able to clearly see God. He wants us to see, understand God as if we were gazing on a photograph of Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to describe how person looks? It could be very difficult. You might describe their hair color, stature, their weight or something they are wearing. You may or may not have success. Yet when you use a photograph, everything is much clearer; you have to say very little. Paul wants us to know God in this sort of way. His prayer for the church at Ephesus, churches throughout Asia minor and churches throughout the world is that they would have a coherent picture of God. Some say that a picture is worth a thousand words. This sort of unambiguous understanding of God is crucial for a healthy church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, God is mysterious. It is impossible to know everything about him. Yet, at the same time, Paul prays that our hearts would be illuminated. He prays that we would begin to fathom God&amp;rsquo;s wonderful work in the world. May we know God in this sort of way. May the eyes of our heart have 20/20 vision.&lt;/p&gt;

We are reminded that we have been called, chosen to be a part of God&amp;rsquo;s work. We are reminded that God&amp;rsquo;s plan of redemption began before the dawn of time.

 		<id>/blog/2013/04/01/Diving-Below-the-Surface</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful to worship as a gathered body this past Sunday. Celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus on this high Sunday was invigorating. With Easter Sunday behind us, we move together into a study of Ephesians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have much work to do as a church family. Adapting to unparalleled change in our culture, we must discern together God&amp;rsquo;s leading. We have at least two groups in our church discerning issues of resources. As we seek the leading of the Spirit, it is crucial to remain centered in God&amp;rsquo;s Word. Our study in Ephesians will aid our understanding of who we are called to be as the people of God. This week, we will explore Ephesians 1:3-13, considering foundational tenets of our worship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, this text is deep. Paul peeks into the eternal purposes of God and describes our role in His plan. While diving below the surface is sometimes challenging, it is essential that we comprehend the magnificence of what God has done for us. It involves understanding that we were doomed without Jesus; yet through his shed blood, we experience tremendous blessing. As we grasp these truths, our natural response is worship. On Sunday, we will consider our redemption. We will probe into the richness of God&amp;rsquo;s work through Jesus. I hope that you will take a few minutes to read Ephesians 1:3-13 as you prepare for worship on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Ephesians provides a full and clear picture of how the church should function. He reminds us our glorious salvation and our appropriate response as we join God in His mission. I look forward to studying this epistle with you.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are down in Georgia this week. I should not be doing church work. Yet, I am preaching on Sunday and I need to do a bit of preparation. I promise I will not do too much :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reviewing the sermon for Sunday. I get pumped up at Easter; it is highest day on the church calendar. Because of Easter, Jesus&#39; suffering makes sense. Because of Easter, God&amp;rsquo;s purposes throughout all of history are made clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we are going to be exploring John&amp;rsquo;s account of the resurrection. There are six accounts in Scripture. Each one looks at the story from a different viewpoint. John seems to focus on Mary Magdalene. Her experience that morning begins with doubt and a fairly pessimistic first response to the empty tomb. Yet her encounter with the risen Jesus changes everything for her. Her doubt quickly shifts to belief when she hears the voice of her Savior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We each experience doubt and belief at different levels. Some are quick to believe, to trust. Others take a bit more time. Yet in the end, Jesus provides what is necessary for each of us. As we approach Sunday, may we be transformed by Easter. May it clarify God&amp;rsquo;s purposes in the world, then and now. May we be reminded that God is worthy of our trust, even when we cannot see the entire picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will gather at &lt;strong&gt;9:30 AM&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Sunday, March 31&lt;/strong&gt; in the lower auditorium for breakfast. We will worship in one combined service at &lt;strong&gt;10:45 AM&lt;/strong&gt; in the sanctuary. I hope to see you then.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I had a conversation with Adam Fink. I was talking with Adam about the work of church moderator. I explained to him that we had experienced much change over the last few years. My hope was that we could settle down a bit and keep things a bit more static. In the past couple of years, we have changed our worship schedule and added staff. These are not insignificant adaptations for any congregation. Little did I know that God would be calling us to more adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some of you already know, we are experiencing budgetary constraints. Giving to the church remains static if not slightly decreased. At the same time, in 2012 we experienced a decrease in giving. We ended the year with a $40,000 deficit. Such decline is characteristic in churches throughout the country. We are not the only ones having to adjust to a new world and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007 three professors at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis studied church giving. They found that baby boomers were donating about 10 percent less to religious bodies than their parents’ generation did at a comparable age — and almost 25 percent less than those parents were donating. A 2010 study by Empty Tomb Inc. reveals that giving to churches declined to 2.4 percent of a donor’s income, lower than during the first years of the Great Depression. We are not in this alone. Mix these stats with the fact that fewer people are attending church and it is no surprise that income is lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had a church-family conversation on stewardship in the months of January and February. We talked about biblical stewardship and our calling to be faithful. As of the end of February, our financial situation has not changed. We are going to need to adjust. As the new CCT begins its work in April, a leading priority will be to develop a balanced budget; this is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been our practice over the past few years, we will be using a discernment process in this endeavor. Budgetary cuts can be difficult; we can not lean into our personal preferences. We must devote ourselves to seeking the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s direction as we move forward. Only He has the necessary wisdom to lead us in the right directions. Perhaps God is calling us to reconsider our use of resources. We may find that cuts do not mean less ministry; they may be a vehicle to empower all of us to be involved in ministry. We no longer have the luxury of plentiful staffing; we will have to find creative and less resource-intense ways of functioning. My prayer is that this challenge will increase our dependence on the Holy Spirit&amp;rsquo;s leading. My hope is that we will adjust in ways that will build up our congregation. I pray that we will be empowered to walk with God in all that He is doing in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The story of Mary pouring perfume on Jesus&#39; feet during an evening banquet is a model for us. Out of all the people in the room that evening, Mary was most in tune with what God was doing in the world. While her action draws criticism, her extravagant gift honors Jesus. Jesus commends her for her sacrifice. As we study this passage together, we will reflect on our own willingness to serve in this posture. John 12:1-8&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Extravagant Worship</title>

 		<id>/blog/2013/03/11/Extravagant-Worship</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you read this week&amp;rsquo;s story, you might find yourself questioning Jesus&#39; stance. Let me fill you in a bit. Jesus is on his way to the cross. He makes a stopover in the town of Bethany. You might remember this place; Lazarus was raised from the dead there. Jesus is revered in that town; it is likely that He also healed a man named Simon (who was a leper) in Bethany. So Simon decides to throw a party for Jesus. He invites his friends, family and maybe everyone in town to his dinner celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, Lazarus and others are reclining at the table, enjoying the food and festivities. And all of a sudden, a strong fragrance fills the room. Mary (Lazarus&#39; and Martha&amp;rsquo;s sister) breaks a bottle of very expensive perfume/ointment and begins to spread it on Jesus&#39; feet/head. She has even let her hair down (Jewish women do not let their hair down in public) and is wiping Jesus&#39; feet with her hair. Her action is costly, perhaps even socially unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disciples are not happy. They complain that the perfume is too expensive to waste. Judas, the treasurer, suggests that the ointment should have been sold and the money given to the poor. How would Jesus respond? Would he celebrate Mary&amp;rsquo;s action or rebuke her outrageous behavior. Besides, Judas has a point. People are starving in the world and such extravagance seems irresponsible. But Jesus responds,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(John 12:7–8 NIV) “Leave her alone &amp;hellip; [It was intended] that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s going on here? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Jesus care about the poor? Why would He affirm such lavish behavior? We will explore the story in depth on Sunday. Without spoiling the sermon, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a hint as to why Jesus accepts her gift. Jesus is on His way to the cross. While the town of Bethany celebrates His miracles, Jesus is preparing for a greater work. Jesus affirms Mary&amp;rsquo;s worship in light of the cross. And in doing so, Jesus holds Mary as a model for you and me. Join us on Sunday as we talk about Mary&amp;rsquo;s unrestrained worship and how we might do the same in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We often envision God as stern and demanding. Yet a series of parables in Luke 15 gives us a different picture of God. God is undignified in His search for what is lost. He goes to extreme measures to reclaim His treasured possesions. As we delve into the infamous parable of the prodigal son, we see God&amp;rsquo;s lavish love for us. Luke 15&lt;/p&gt;

 		<link href="/blog/2013/03/04/Prodigal-God"/>
 		<updated>2013-03-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/03/04/Prodigal-God</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I few years ago, I read a book by Timothy Keller entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594484023/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=wadblo-20&amp;amp;camp=0&amp;amp;creative=0&amp;amp;linkCode=as4&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1594484023&amp;amp;adid=0GZYAZ34SY0W3PJ9ER5Q&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;The Prodigal God&lt;/a&gt;. The title might catch you off guard. Perhaps you remember the story of the Prodigal Son from Luke 15. Keller makes the assertion that the story is inappropriately entitled. It is not the story of the son; rather the father is the main character. As we come to Luke 15 this week, I am reminded of this truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story/parable is the third of three parables. The first two are about lost items (a coin and a sheep). The third story describes a son&amp;rsquo;s rebellion; he insists on an early inheritance and blows it on wild living. When he reaches rock bottom (eating with the pigs), he figures he will return home begging for an inferior position in his father&amp;rsquo;s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often focus on the excessive, reckless lifestyle of the son. Yet Keller contends that the point of the story is the unrestrained forgiveness of the father. Two words highlight the father&amp;rsquo;s action in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 15:20 NIV) “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first word (translated in the NIV as &lt;em&gt;filled with compassion&lt;/em&gt;) is &lt;em&gt;splagchnizomai&lt;/em&gt;. This word is used in the NT twelve times. It often describes Jesus&#39; feeling toward the crowd or the lost. Matthew describes Jesus in his Gospel,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 9:36 NIV) When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The father could have been angry; he could have resenting the foolish action of his son. Yet he is overwhelmed with compassion. And his concern prompts his response. What happens next is an unusual maneuver for a first century grown man. He runs. The Greek literally reads,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Father saw and had compassion and ran!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This description may have caused the religious leaders to gasp. A dignified father would stand, looking down his nose as his son approached. A stately gentleman would not have exhibited such behavior. Yet Jesus describes a running father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we consider this story on Sunday, we find a robe-tucking, undignified father longing for his son&amp;rsquo;s return. God&amp;rsquo;s behavior in this parable (the father is God) is extravagant. Join us on Sunday as we explore this profound picture of God and consider the ramifications for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;author: Wade Allen
title: Religion vs. Relationship
date: 2013-02-25
layout: blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;comments: yes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IAhDGYlpqY&quot;&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; was posted on YouTube about religion. Since that time, it has been watched over 24 million times; you might say it went viral. In this video, Tony Anderson shares his disdain for religion. While he passionately calls people to love Jesus, he exposes the flawed nature of the institutional church. So what do we do with this? Do we throw out organized religion in light of Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many have written about the dangers of organized religion. Charles Kimball in &lt;em&gt;When Religion Becomes Evil&lt;/em&gt; describes the warning signs. Kimball goes a bit further than I would. He proposes that absolute truth is dangerous; I understand absolute truth as necessary and affirmed in Scripture.  At the same time, he sheds light on the destructive potential of organized religion. Certainly Jesus observed a broken-down religious system as he encountered the religious leaders of His day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s text (Luke 13:1-9), we are reminded of the peril of self-righteous, rule-centered religion. In the wake of recent tragedies, the religious leaders of Jesus&#39; day are pointing fingers. They blame the misfortune on the sin of the victims. Jesus rebukes their claim. Twice (Luke 13:3, 5), Jesus states,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus challenges their finger-pointing. He criticizes their posture of religious elitism. When those in our culture criticize religion, perhaps they are intending to target this sort. I would agree that the church includes finger-pointing, judgmental, grace-deficient members. And this sort of posture &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; opposed to Jesus&#39; Kingdom. Yet, the church also includes humble, grace-filled, Jesus-following believers who do their best to live in the Kingdom of God. We have to be careful that we do not destroy the beautiful body of the church as we attack religion. Certainly, Jesus is active in the sustaining and equipping of His body (the Church). Paul writes in his letter to the Ephesians,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 5:25–27 NIV) Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus is active in building his church. It is essential that the church remain connected to Him. I hope that such YouTube videos will not portray Jesus as disconnected from His body. I agree with Tony Anderson. The church is sometimes a mess and often gravitates toward fake religiosity. Certainly, Jesus abhors this behavior. I just hope that viewers will not diminish the role of Christ&amp;rsquo;s church in the building of His Kingdom. A church empowered by relationship with Jesus is God&amp;rsquo;s desire and design. Can religion be bad? Sure. But the church equipped and nurtured in Jesus has the power to transform this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 3:21 NIV) to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But looking back, they understand the significance of a mountaintop journey with Jesus. As we consider Luke 9:28–36, we are challenged in our own tendencies to stay on the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Jesus and Change</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/02/21/Jesus-and-Change"/>
 		<updated>2013-02-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/02/21/Jesus-and-Change</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we walk through the season of Lent, we are reminded of the difficult journey of Jesus. We often romanticize Jesus&amp;rsquo;s earthly ministry. Sure, it would have been glorious for those He healed. The demon possessed, the lepers, the sick would have been overwhelmed with joy when Jesus showed up. Yet an element of discomfort characterizes the ministry of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, he did not enter a comfortable world. He spends much of his time walking around in sandals in the arid, hot Middle East countryside. He does not own a car, a house nor does he have the support of a wife and children. Through the season of Lent, we are challenged by Jesus&amp;rsquo;s lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was Jesus&amp;rsquo;s lifestyle unconventional, but His message disquiets his would be followers. He often challenges them in improbable ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 9:23 NIV) If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can any of us honestly say that we live up to this? When we really think about the implications of Jesus&amp;rsquo;s message, we get edgy. We live in a world that teaches us to work hard in order to succeed and to win at all costs. Jesus reminds us, however&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Mark 10:31 NIV) But many who are first will be last, and the last first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but this sort of talk makes me uneasy. Throughout Jesus&amp;rsquo;s ministry, he disturbs the status quo. The religious leaders are so threatened by him, they seek to crucify Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It is only in hindsight that we begin to understand Jesus&amp;rsquo;s purpose. As Paul wrote to the church in Ephesus,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Ephesians 1:7-8 NIV) In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; God, through Jesus, was doing a great work. But at the time, people had trouble understanding what He was up to. God was prompting them out of their comfort zones, into His mission. How tragic for those who failed to join him! As we make our way toward Easter, may we be reminded that God continues to challenge us in uncomfortable ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As a church, we continue to transition. In the coming months, we may be challenged to rethink how we do ministry; budgetary constraints may force us to change the way we operate. While such talk may make us anxious, we can be sure that God is in control. While no one likes change, the season of Lent reminds us that Jesus was an agent of change and how can we as Easter people fail to follow His example?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; May we be open to God&amp;rsquo;s movement. May we continually seek his direction as we navigate the challenging waters of this age. May we understand that our circumstances are not coincidental; God continually prompts us to follow him in new ways. And just like the early followers of Jesus, we will discover the joy of following God into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Open Doors</title>

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The past few months have broght some encouraging developments on the
ministry front in my work with YFC (Youth for Christ). My initial plan
to establish a ministry presence at Muncie Central High School was to
begin leading a weekly gathering on campus. After learning of concerns
that this could potentially compete with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fca.org/&quot;&gt;FCA (Fellowship of
Christian Atheletes)&lt;/a&gt; presence on Central’s campus,
I remembered some advice that I gleaned while in seminary: “Watch to see
where God is working and join Him.”(see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:17,%2019-20&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;John 5:17,
19–20&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2814752285202790648#fn:1&quot; title=&quot;see footnote&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than starting a new Christian group at CHS, I decided to look
more closely at what Christian students were already doing. I learned
that FCA was started by Central’s current Principal, Tom Jarvis, a few
years ago when he was still the athletic director. Since then, the FCA
Thursday morning gatherings have grown to a weekly attendance of several
dozen students. I’ve made a point to be at nearly every FCA Thursday
morning gathering since last October, and this has provided some great
opportunities for forming relationships with CHS students and faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; You may be wondering, “Isn’t YFC about outreach? Why is Matt spending
most of his time hanging out with the Christian kids?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yes, YFC is about outreach. Being among the unchurched is vital.
However, as I wrote in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattheadley.blogspot.com/2013/01/yfc-october-2012-newsletter.html&quot;&gt;last
update&lt;/a&gt;,
I intend to focus my energy on discipleship. My reasoning is this: Can’t
outreach be done more effectively by a team of Spirit–filled students
who spend all day at school than by one 28 year-old dude on 15 hours a
week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In this vein, I’ve been encouraged to see what God has been up to among
the FCA group through the past few weeks. God appears to be prompting
the student leaders to create opportunities for more relational time
outside of the large-group Thursday morning event. Because of this, I’ve
discovered an opportunity to help the guys start a Bible study group
soon after the girls did, and this week we met for our first study in
Paul’s letter to the Romans. In addition to digging into God’s Word, we
will be sharing with each other what God is doing in our lives, praying
together, and discovering how God is calling us to respond in concrete
ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I’m excited about what is to come, but I still need clarity in what the
next steps should be. Please pray that God will continue to open doors
as I look for opportunities to promote a culture of discipleship among
the CHS community. How might he be calling you to participate in what He
is doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Peace!&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Stepping Out</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/02/18/Stepping-Out"/>
 		<updated>2013-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/02/18/Stepping-Out</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This Sunday, we will be exploring one of the strangest stories in the Gospels. Jesus&#39; ministry is coming to a close. He is talking more and more about leaving, about dying. I am not sure that the disciples fully understood his predictions. Midway through Luke 9, we are able to peer into a private conversation between Jesus and his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 9:18-20 NIV) Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, “Who do the crowds say I am?” &amp;hellip; “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter is the first to speak up. He confirms that Jesus is the Christ. Yet Peter does not seem to comprehend the full ramifications of this claim. Jesus explains,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 9:22 NIV) The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus clarifies his mission and the requirements of his followers in fulfilling the work of his Kingdom. I imagine a lot of head scratching in the group that day. You would think they might begin to grasp his words. But the next story reveals their lack of understanding. We read,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 9:28 NIV) About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we will explore this encounter on the mountain. It looks more like a sci-fi movie than a story from first century Palestine. Jesus lights up in an unexplainable white glow. Visitors, who have been dead for hundreds of years (Moses and Elijah), show up. They are in conversation with Jesus. In the end, the disciples are left speechless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key point in this story is Peter&amp;rsquo;s failed attempt to set up shop on the mountain. Peter sees the spectacular happenings and longs to stay. He suggests setting up tents and worshiping on the mountain. It is almost as if he completely forgot Jesus&#39; words from eight days ago. Perhaps he remembers them but desperately wants to avoid them. Either way, he completely misses what God is doing. God is confirming Jesus&#39; identity and planning the redemption of the world. Peter wants to hide out on the mountain in selfish comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we are quick to mock Peter&amp;rsquo;s actions, we struggle with the same desire. We are sometimes eager to set up cozy environments. We enjoy the serenity of living apart from the world. Yet, God calls us to join Him on His mission. He refuses to condone our self-centered ministries. We must get into the world if we truly desire to follow Jesus. May we be attentive to the work of His Kingdom. May we eagerly join Him as he transforms our world through you and me.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Jesus&amp;rsquo;s baptism, he travels into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. For 40 days, he eats nothing and battles temptation.

 		<title>Dealing with Temptation</title>

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We rarely order dessert when we go out to eat. Large serving sizes leave us incapable of digesting more food. However, there is usually a small display with full color pictures showcasing the kitchen&amp;rsquo;s confections. Many have given names to the after-dinner delights. When chocolate is the main ingredient, you will sometimes see the word &lt;em&gt;temptation&lt;/em&gt; in the description. We understand the ramifications of indulging in a calorie packed, sugary cake or ice cream. Our waistline will suffer as a result. Yet, it is hard to resist the savory treat. While we have lightened the word, relegating it to eating a piece of cake, true temptation is powerful and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Jesus is led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. Luke records the culmination of a forty-day fast in which Satan tempts Jesus in three ways. On Sunday, we will discuss the intricacy of each temptation. Yet, all three temptations have a common theme. Satan is attempting to separate Jesus from the Father and Spirit. He questions Jesus&#39; role as the Son of God by steering him away from His calling. In each instance, Satan offers Jesus an alternative route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus&#39; willingness to experience temptation verifies his desire to identify with you and me. The author of Hebrews describes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Hebrews 4:15 NIV) For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are &amp;ndash; yet was without sin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more than that, Jesus models for us how to handle temptation. Each of our temptations will be different. Satan knows our weaknesses and capitalizes on our inclinations to stray from God&amp;rsquo;s design. But we can draw from Jesus&#39; experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, Jesus is Spirit-led and Spirit-empowered as he encounters temptation. Luke begins this story by telling us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 4:1 NIV) Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that Jesus is filled with the Spirit of God. He is the Son of God. How could He not be filled with the Spirit? Yet, this is key to Luke&amp;rsquo;s description of Jesus&#39; temptations. Jesus is not operating in his own strength. Think about it, He has not had food for forty days. He must have been famished, mentally and physically drained. But Jesus does not find strength in the physical. He draws on the power of the Spirit as he battles the Evil One. It is easy to dismiss a Spirit-filled life as reserved for Jesus. Yet, you and I are promised strength that only comes through the power of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Jesus responds to each temptation with Scripture. He retaliates with God&amp;rsquo;s Word in each case. Jesus&#39; knowledge and dependence on Scripture is primary. If Jesus, the Son of God, uses Scripture to battle temptation, so should we. If we are biblically illiterate, we are walking on thin ice in regards to temptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we delve into this text. May we learn to appropriately respond to the temptations in our lives. May we look to Jesus as our model and guide.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Hearts in the Right Place</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/02/04/Hearts-in-the-Right-Place"/>
 		<updated>2013-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/02/04/Hearts-in-the-Right-Place</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have to be honest; this week&amp;rsquo;s sermon will not be preached for the first time on Sunday. I shared this message at Taylor University in January. When I was asked to speak at Taylor&amp;rsquo;s chapel, I felt that this text would be especially applicable to college students. The stage of life, often called late adolescence, is a season of learning and discovery. In this stage, we are often building patterns that will continue for the rest of our life. I wanted to challenge these college students with the idea of stewardship, of taking what we have been given and using it for the Kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have mentioned already, stewardship is more than money. Sure, it involves money, but it also involves our time and energy. In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Jesus offers incredible insight into how our investments affect our hearts. The teaching is succinct,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 6:19–21 NIV) “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we will explore this teaching in detail. We will consider what it means to &lt;em&gt;store up treasures&lt;/em&gt;. We will reflect on the eternal ramifications of earthly investments compared to heavenly investments. But for the purpose of this blog entry, I want to focus on this last sentence. Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 6:21 NIV) For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus understands our inner being. He formed us, created us and designed us. He knows how we work. Jesus recognizes that our hearts will naturally gravitate to the places where we put our time, attention and money (our treasure). It is just how it works. This is an important truth as we talk about stewardship. We often picture God in need of our resources. We reason, &amp;ldquo;We should give back to God so that the church can function, the poor can have their needs met and missionaries can travel abroad.&amp;rdquo; But the reality is that God already has all the resources He needs. God does not need us to give. We read in Psalm 50,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 50:9–10 NIV) I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens, for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God wants us to faithfully steward our resources because he wants our hearts. God deeply desires that our hearts be integrated into the Kingdom of God. And He knows that our hearts will follow our treasure. Do you have trouble thinking about the things of God? Do you long to be more connected to your heavenly Father? Do you want your heart to be in sync with God&amp;rsquo;s heart? The solution is simple. Begin to place your treasure in the things of God; your heart will naturally follow. May our hearts gravitate toward God&amp;rsquo;s heart. May we learn to &lt;em&gt;store up&lt;/em&gt; in the right places so that our most valuable treasure, our heart, will be in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/01/23/Risk</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was engaged in my doctoral work at Northern Seminary, I read extensively about the ways in which culture and the church are shifting. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a seminary student to see that both society and the church are changing. Sociologists will tell you that younger generations are less active in the life of the church. The numbers vary, yet the decline is anything but minimal. Some reports indicate that church attendance has moved from 65% in the Builder generation to only 4% in the current generation of twenty-somethings. How is the church going to respond?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the books in my studies was written by Eddie Gibbs,; it is entitled &lt;em&gt;ChurchNext: Quantum Changes in How We Do Ministry&lt;/em&gt;. The book was written in 2000 (it is almost 13 years old); yet his predictions have proved to be accurate. Gibbs describes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the following chapters is to attempt to identify some of the major storm centers through which churches have to navigate. (Gibbs, 11)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it would be impossible to detail the entire book in this article, Gibbs describes the need to experiment with different models of ministry. He explains essential skill-sets for pastors that include deciphering the complex changes in our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastors must be equally skilled in exegeting both Scripture and culture, bringing the understanding derived from this interplay to the task of applying biblically grounded insights to the issues of postmodernity.  They are challenged not just to be able to think clearly but to have the nerve and faith to act decisively in navigating through stormy and uncharted waters. (Gibbs, 32)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the waters of our world are stormy. We will not be able to continue business as usual. We will need to discern God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit as we respond to our changing culture. Gibbs describes the posture of the congregation as willing to take risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a culture of chaos, experimentation and risk taking are the order of the day. (Gibbs, 34)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could Gibbs be right? Could it be that we will need to take more risks than our fathers and grandfathers? Could it be that we need to discard the old adage, &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ve always done it that way before,&amp;rdquo; if we want to survive? This year, we may be faced with difficult decisions as a congregation. Budgetary constraints may force us to reconsider how we utilize our resources. We may need to discontinue or reform ministries that have existed for years. I ask each attendee and member to prayerfully consider a new posture of flexibility and risk. It may be the only way to chart the treacherous waters of today&amp;rsquo;s world.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>A Hurt Toe</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2013/01/22/A-Hurt-Toe"/>
 		<updated>2013-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2013/01/22/A-Hurt-Toe</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Several months ago, I showed up on Sunday morning wearing one of Dawson&amp;rsquo;s sandals. It looked kind of funny wearing a dress shoe on one foot and a Jordan sandal on the other. But I was not trying to make a fashion statement; my attire was a matter of necessity. A few nights before, I was washing dishes. A drinking glass slipped out of my hand and crashed onto the counter; a shard of glass pierced my big toe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no stranger to foot injuries. Several years ago, my toenail popped off as I ascended from a subway station in Atlanta. I caught it on the cement stairs while wearing flip-flops. Before that, I twisted my ankle while jogging, fracturing a bone in my foot. Adam Fink commented, &amp;ldquo;You tend to hurt your foot a lot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how dysfunction in your smallest body part can throw a wrench in your day to day activities. A simple walk upstairs can turn into a multi-faceted ordeal. In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Paul uses the analogy of the body and its parts as he teaches the church about spiritual gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 Corinthians 12:12 NIV) The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul describes the tension between a unified body and the variety of its parts. We are one, yet we function in an assortment of areas. We must keep this tension in mind as we think about spiritual gifts. We function in various ways; yet each part is necessary and contributes to the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my disabled toe was healing, I was unable to carry out my daily workout; I was impaired. The injured body part affected the whole body. As we gather on Sunday, we will consider Paul&amp;rsquo;s description of the body and its parts. May we get a clear picture of a healty body, living into its full potential as the church of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Psalm 29, David challenges us to give God credit in all things. But giving credit to God is more than lip service. It includes giving God what he is due. This plays out in the way in which we allocate our resources (our time, our money, our attention). And the promise of this psalm is that when we truly make God King (ascribe to Him all that is due Him), he blesses his people with peace.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2013/01/07/Ascribe</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, we turn to a Psalm in our stewardship series. A while back, we did a series on the Psalms; we discovered the rich treasury of poetry and reflection in this ancient collection. Psalm 29, this week&amp;rsquo;s text, was written by David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David is one interesting character to say the least. His story includes all the components of a good movie. From humble beginnings to an ascension to power, David&amp;rsquo;s story includes tension, drama, attempted murder, friendship and betrayal. As King, his story gets more interesting. The plot involves adultery, murder, father and son rivalries, forgiveness and restoration. By the time it is all over, David&amp;rsquo;s kingdom is perhaps the greatest in Israel&amp;rsquo;s history. From worldly standards, he was tremendously successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With success comes the potential for arrogance. It is easy to believe that we are somehow responsible for our good fortune. But David is careful to give God credit. He writes in Psalm 29,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 29:1–2 NIV) Ascribe to the LORD, O mighty ones, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three times, David uses the word &lt;em&gt;ascribe&lt;/em&gt;. This seems to be a key word in this psalm. The word is translated different ways in the Old Testament (come, choose, bring), but the most common translation is &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt;. It has to do with giving someone what they are due. David is reminding us that God is due the glory. In other words, we are to credit God for all He has done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may have been easy for David to take credit for his success. No doubt, he was a powerful and effective leader. Yet he understands his success as coming from God. As we consider our lives, we must be careful to &lt;em&gt;ascribe the glory&lt;/em&gt; to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we explore how this plays out in our lives. David&amp;rsquo;s admonition is more than lip service. To adequately credit God involves action. The foundational notion of crediting God challenges us to consider our calendar, our financial resources, our talents and our energy. Are we giving God credit in the way we use the gifts He has given us?&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2012/12/31/Treasure</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you ever pay attention to Nativity scenes? Sometimes they seem far too clean. Mary and Joseph look more like royalty than ordinary teenagers from Nazareth. The shepherds seldom appear as rag-tag as first century sheep herders would have been. Many Nativity scenes include Magi; wise men from the East come to worship the baby Jesus. While it is unlikely that they stood around with the shepherds (they arrive at a house in Matthew 2:11), the Magi play an important role in the birth narrative of Jesus. Their worship serves as a model for authentic worship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sunday, the church around the world celebrates Epiphany. The story of the wise men reminds us that Jesus came for the entire world. We find pagans bowing down and presenting gifts to Jesus. As I prepared for this week&amp;rsquo;s sermon, one word in Matthew&amp;rsquo;s gospel rang out. I had not noticed it before. Matthew tells us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 2:11 NIV) Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had always pictured modern Christmas presents with bows and shiny paper. But the word used in the text describes more than trinkets. The word that is translated &lt;em&gt;treasures&lt;/em&gt; is only used 16 times in the entire New Testament. The word is sometimes translated as &lt;em&gt;storehouse&lt;/em&gt;. It is more than a gift box; it describes a treasure chest of great value. Jesus spoke of treasure,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 6:19-21 NIV) &amp;ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves &lt;strong&gt;treasures&lt;/strong&gt; on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves &lt;strong&gt;treasures&lt;/strong&gt; in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your &lt;strong&gt;treasure&lt;/strong&gt; is, there your heart will be also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus uses the word three times in this teaching. This is the same Greek word that Matthew uses to describe the gifts of the Magi. This connection is significant. The Magi bring valuable, sacrificial offerings to the baby Jesus. We are instructed by the adult Jesus to store our treasure in eternal, Kingdom places. In other words, where we place our treasure is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pagan Magi model worship for us. They lay their treasure at the feet of Jesus. Most Nativity scenes depict the Magi in a posture of bowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 2:11 NIV) they bowed down and worshiped him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But their bowing extends beyond their posture. It includes their giving treasure, they place their valuables at the feet of the eternal King. May our worship be more than lip service. May our worship be more than enduring a few songs and sermon each week. May it include placing our treasure, our sacrificial offerings into the work of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<updated>2012-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/12/18/Into-2013</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we come to the close of another year, we often reflect on where we
have been and where we are going. As a church, 2012 has been a
particularly eventful year. We changed our Sunday morning schedule in
the spring and hired additional staff in the summer. Both of these
decisions involved a lengthy discernment process that began in 2011 and received strong congregational support. Nevertheless, such changes are significant for any congregation. Change is
never easy; it always requires adjustment on some level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say that 2013 will be the year of stability. It would be
nice to sit back and not have to think about significant changes.
Unfortunately, the world keeps changing around us and challenges us to
adapt. As we look into next year, I want to highlight at least two areas
of focus for January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stewardship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area of focus for 2013 will be stewardship. While this includes
financial stewardship, it is much more. As a congregation by necessity, we are
shifting leadership and ministry support toward younger attendees and
members. As we have experienced loss in recent years of ageing members (to
death and assisted living facilities), we are finding the pews filled
with younger people. This generation will need to pick up where the
older generation has left off. This is not to diminish the continued
participation but needed care of older members, but we must consider what
will be in the next twenty years. We will need to reconsider how we use
our resources as a part of this process. But at the same time, everyone
needs to be faithful in time, talent and financial resources if First
Baptist Church is to remain viable. We will be having a family
conversation regarding stewardship in the early part of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Communities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working with a small team to implement new
communities/discipleship initiatives at the beginning of next year. We
have found that discipleship looks a bit different for the younger
generation. While the values are the same, culture has shifted
significantly in the last fifty years. We will be piloting a new
community beginning in February. This community has the potential for
great impact in our congregation and our local community. I hope that some of
you will consider joining this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will 2013 be a year of change? I am sure that it will be. What will
those changes be and how will they affect each of us? I am not sure.
Yet, I am convinced that God will lead us and direct us toward His
vision for First Baptist Church. We may need to shift our resources; we
may need to try new methods of ministry. May God give us the ability to
hear His voice as we navigate our ever-changing world. May He give us
the courage to adapt to new callings as we continue to fulfill the Great
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 28:19 NIV) Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed a trend. After recently donning some new leadership and
life roles, many good-natured folks have inquired about what I’ve done
with my life lately (besides create the illusion of a perpetual chaotic
furor). What you’re reading is one attempt towards bucking this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe good leaders tell stories. While I don’t have the strongest
track record for consistent updates on

carve out time to tell stories here of what God is up to in my life and
ministry. Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four big things began in my life between July and October of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: Youth Ministry. I was called to join the staff a parachurch
organization called Muncie Area Youth for Christ
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yfc.net/&quot;&gt;(YFC)&lt;/a&gt; as the coordinator for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/MuncieCentralCampusLife&quot;&gt;“Campus
Life”&lt;/a&gt; ministry in
the Muncie Central High School community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August: Church Leadership. After three years of serving &lt;a href=&quot;http://fbcmuncie.org&quot;&gt;First
Baptist Church of Muncie&lt;/a&gt; as a worship arts
director, I was called to serve as an associate pastor, broadening
my previous leadership role to include outreach ministry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September: Parenthood. My wife and I met Hannah Joy, an amazing new person who is also our first child. Three words: Beautiful. Scary.
Hilarious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: Education. For the grand finale of my journey through an
M.Div. with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seminary.edu/&quot;&gt;Northern Seminary&lt;/a&gt;, I began a
chaplaincy internship with the gifted staff in the spiritual care
department at Ball Memorial Hospital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These new commitments have presented me with some exciting and
formidable challenges. I’ve been humbled by the patience and grace
friends around me have extended as I work to balance these commitments
out. I hope that, as I tell my story and how God is working through it,
you will see him moving in your own life, in our community, and maybe
even the world. Peace!&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Giving into God</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/12/17/Giving-into-God"/>
 		<updated>2012-12-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/12/17/Giving-into-God</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week is the last Sunday before Christmas. As we draw near to this sacred holiday, we will consider Mary&amp;rsquo;s response to God&amp;rsquo;s calling in her life. In the first chapter of Luke, we journey with Mary to her relative&amp;rsquo;s house. This 3-4 day journey must have included reflection, doubt but ultimately ends in confirmation. As we follow God, we sometimes experience similar expeditions. Think about it; Mary is told that she is going to be a mother. She is not married, nor has she engaged in unfaithful behavior. How will her relatives believe her story? Joseph will surely abandon her. Will she be deemed insane?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we read this story, we find Mary&amp;rsquo;s response instructive. She models an appropriate posture as God calls her into the difficult. In the early verses of the chapter, we find Mary&amp;rsquo;s response to the angel one of submission and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 1:38 NIV) “I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May it be to me as you have said.” Then the angel left her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to wonder if doubts started to creep in a few days later. You have to wonder if anxiety overwhelmed her as she made the trek through the Judaean hill country. I love how this part of the story ends. When Mary shows up at Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s house, she does not have to deliver a speech. Perhaps she had rehearsed what she would say to her relative. Yet when the door opens, the Holy Spirit takes over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 1:41–42 NIV) When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary responds with a song. The song recorded in Luke 1:46-55. It is similar in tone to a Psalm. It celebrates the fulfillment of the prophets through this child. God&amp;rsquo;s promise to Abraham is connected with what God is doing through Mary&amp;rsquo;s pregnancy. But a key phrase grabs my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 1:46–47 NIV) My soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary describes an inner peace that contradicts her condition. She speaks of her &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt; glorifying God. Her &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; experiences joy. We discussed (on Sunday) the difference between joy and happiness. Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that God&amp;rsquo;s calling to Mary was not easy. Her world hung in the balance as an unwed mother. Yet an indescribable inner peace glorifies God. Is is possible to &lt;em&gt;rejoice&lt;/em&gt; when God calls us to experience the difficult? As we come to the close of 2012, may we be willing to open our hearts to God&amp;rsquo;s promptings in our life. May Christmas be more than a season, may the spirit of this season extend into 2013. May we learn from Mary what it means to truly give ourself to God.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our lives are often overwhelmed by the anxiety of our current circumstances. In this Advent season, we are challenged to refocus on the greater realities. As Paul instructed the Philippians church, we must place our anxieties in God’s care. As we are able to do this, we will experience a piece that is beyond understanding. Philippians 4:4-7&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2012/12/10/Joy</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year, our extended family is traveling to Indiana to spend time with us during the holidays. It is been 12 years since Christy&amp;rsquo;s sister has been to our home. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to avoid packing up and traveling south; but now we have to get the house ready for company. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal for you, but for my wife, everything has to be perfect. While I&amp;rsquo;m doing my best to dissuade her from major projects, she will do a bit of house-transformation before the company arrives. Last week, I found myself drawing out 3 foot letters for our mantle; Christy got the idea from Pinterest. She covered the wooden letters in gift wrap. I have to admit, they look pretty cool. The three letters spell out a common Christmas word; J-O-Y. We see this word plastered on billboards, coffee mugs and storefront displays throughout the season. But what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems there is some confusion about the word &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt;. Most equate it with happiness. But the word is much deeper. Happiness has to do with our circumstances. If your job is going well, relationships are strong, life is generally good, you might say that you are happy. But joy is has different roots; joy does not depend on our circumstances. The Scriptures instruct us to have &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt;; they use the word &lt;em&gt;rejoice&lt;/em&gt;. In our text this week, Paul emphasizes this word. He says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Philippians 4:4 NIV) Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t say it once; he says it twice. Imagine Paul dictating this letter. He tells his scribe, &amp;ldquo;rejoice in the Lord always&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Let me make myself clear, I will say it again, rejoice!&amp;rdquo; Why does Paul say it twice? Why does he seem so emphatic? You see, to rejoice is independent of our circumstances. Paul is writing this letter from prison. He is awaiting a trial that may result in his death. It is in this context that he is able to instruct the church at Philippi. Their joy is to be rooted in God. As we study the context, we learn that the church in Philippi will experience intense persecution in the years to come. They will experience not-so-happy circumstances. Nevertheless, Paul encourages them to be joyful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul instructs the believers in Philippi to refocus their attention to God&amp;rsquo;s work in them. He challenges them to place their current anxieties at the feet of God; God will then exchange their worries for immeasurable peace. As we consider this text, we find this no easy task. Is it possible to trade our anxiety for God&amp;rsquo;s peace? As we gather this week, may God empower us to refocus in this way. May God give us the strength to rejoice, even when life is not happy. May we learn to live in Paul&amp;rsquo;s posture, depending on God in all things, and all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt; Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Philippians allows us to peer into his heart. He is confident that God will complete the work He began in the Philippians church. He anticipates that this work one day come to an end as Jesus returns. His prayer for the Philippians is that they would also live in this anticipation of Jesus&amp;rsquo;s return. As you and I explore this text, we are challenged to live in a posture of expectancy and urgency. God will one day return; this truth should drive us as we live out the gospel in our world. Philippians 1:3-11&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Focused on the End</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/12/03/Focused-on-the-End"/>
 		<updated>2012-12-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/12/03/Focused-on-the-End</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past week, we talked about the need for urgency and anticipation in the Advent season. In particular, we discussed the need to look forward to Jesus&amp;rsquo;s second coming. We continue to consider this challenge in the coming weeks. For the next two weeks, we will be surveying Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Philippians. As we examine the introduction, we see the anticipation of Jesus&amp;rsquo;s return as a primary focus. On Sunday, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about the way in which ancient letters were composed. There is a pattern or style of writing for these letters. As we examine the style, it gives us an understanding of Paul&amp;rsquo;s intentions. The section we will be studying is called a &amp;ldquo;Thanksgiving&amp;rdquo; element. In this part of the letter, the author offers a prayer for the recipient. As we read Paul&amp;rsquo;s prayer, we are able to peer into his heart; we are able to understand what he valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have children, you pray for them. Sometimes you pray for academic achievement, healthy relationships and spiritual connection with God. You want the best for your kids; the way you pray for them indicates your priorities. In this section of Philippians, we are able to see Paul&amp;rsquo;s priorities for the church at Philippi. He prays for a unified body. If they are together in mind and spirit, it will mean spiritual health for them. Paul says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Philippians 1:10 NIV) so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see it in the text? Paul understands it necessary for the church to navigate waters of discord and strife. He knows that unity will produce holiness. It will not be easy; but their struggle will be only for a while. He says, &amp;ldquo;until the day of Christ.&amp;rdquo; In other words, when Jesus returns, all will be made right. The church will no longer need to strive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will look at other passages in the Pauline epistles regarding the day of Christ. We will see this day as central to the New Testament writers. And if it was foremost for them, it should be primary for us. As we continue through the season of Advent, may we learn to anticipate Jesus&amp;rsquo;s return. May we learn to balance the here and now with the promise of Christ&amp;rsquo;s return.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2012/11/26/drunk</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe that December is almost here. We pulled our Christmas decorations out of the attic this weekend, turned on holiday music and transformed our interior and exterior decorations. We even indulged in a couple of holiday movies. It was a festive time for our family. We began our month-long celebration of Christmas. But Christmas is not yet here. It does not arrive until December 25. It may be more accurate to say that we began the &lt;em&gt;anticipation&lt;/em&gt; of Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sunday, we celebrate the first Sunday of Advent. Advent is not Christmas. Advent is the season of anticipation prior to Christmas. We often lose sight of this as we have succumbed to cultural understandings of the holiday season. Yet, we should learn to live in Advent. This year, we will follow the lectionary passages during Advent. This year&amp;rsquo;s texts point to the second coming of Jesus. We will spend four Sundays considering the urgent and expectant posture of Scripture regarding Jesus&amp;rsquo;s return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various interpretations have confused the matter, Scripture is clear that Jesus will return. This week, we will look at Jesus&amp;rsquo;s description of his return; next week, we will consider Paul&amp;rsquo;s writings to the Philippians about Christ&amp;rsquo;s return. How do we make sense of such a complex issue? When is it going to happen? How will it unfold? What clues do we have in Scripture about it? How are we to respond to Scripture&amp;rsquo;s teaching?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would take pages to unpack these questions. I will not attempt such a feat. Yet, I will point to Jesus&amp;rsquo;s advice to us; we are instructed toward a particular posture. Jesus warns,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 21:34 NIV)  Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Jesus saying? The word &lt;em&gt;dissipation&lt;/em&gt; describes a drunken headache, a hangover. Hangovers make it difficult to focus on work or chores. No doubt, the alcohol steals our attention. Jesus understands the impairment of worldly anxieties. He knows that we have the tendency to be tipsy on the cares of this world. They prevent our urgency, our anticipation of Jesus returning. When is the last time you thought about Jesus&amp;rsquo;s return? I have to admit that His coming does not often receive my focus. I seldom concentrate on Jesus&amp;rsquo;s promise to return. Yet, Scripture writers put intense emphasis on Jesus&amp;rsquo;s return. Jesus tells us to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 21:36 NIV)  Be always on the watch, and pray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May we learn to share this anticipation. May we shake off the hangover of worldly anxieties. May we clearly look toward Jesus&amp;rsquo;s return with expectancy. I hope you will join as we worship in the season of Advent. I pray that our engagement of these texts will enlighten Jesus&amp;rsquo;s promise and our prayer,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Revelation 22:20 ESV) “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We will also reflect the sermon on the call of God in our own lives. Jonah was more concerned about his own comfort, less concerned about following God’s mission in the world.

 		<link href="/blog/2012/11/12/reluctant"/>

 		<id>/blog/2012/11/12/reluctant</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, the children will be presenting a musical on the story of Jonah. If you grew up in church, you know the story. A prophet is called by God to go to a savage city called Nineveh. He is hesitant &amp;hellip; no, he flat-out disobeys God. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t go to Nineveh; he takes off in the other direction. A storm batters his ship on his flight from God. In ancient times, tempests of this sort were understood as tantrums of the gods. Jonah&amp;rsquo;s shipmates cast lots to determine who has unsettled the gods. Jonah is identified as the culprit. To make a long story short, he is tossed into the sea, swallowed by a big fish, spit onto dry land. God comes to him a second time. This time he obeys. The story continues with Jonah unenthusiastically making the trek in the right direction. When he arrives in Nineveh, the people respond positively to his message. You might think he would be pleased. Rather, he is disappointed that God has offered salvation to the people of Nineveh. God uses a shade tree to communicate the value of all people to a disheartened Jonah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on this story, we are reminded of our own tendency to walk away from God&amp;rsquo;s direction. God often calls us to unfavorable places. We resist by ignoring God or even going the other direction. I am not sure how God might be prompting you these days. Perhaps He is calling you to a new vocation or new city. Perhaps he is calling you to greater involvement in a particular ministry. While I cannot determine God&amp;rsquo;s voice in your life, I am certain that He calls us join Him in His mission. Joining God requires us to submit our way to His way. Jonah was not given a choice in the matter. In time, he was pressed to go God&amp;rsquo;s route. Perhaps our promptings will not include being swallowed by a fish. Maybe God will urge us in different ways. But God will not acquiesce to our resistance; he will not change His mind. He will not allow us to opt for plan B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May God give us the strength to heed his calling. May he grant us the joy of walking in His way. May we be unlike Jonah, ready to go with God wherever His mission takes us.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the closing scenes of Genesis, we are reminded that God’s story is not over. As Jacob and Joseph pass from the scene, the promise of deliverance looms. As the curtain closes in Genesis, Joseph is embalmed and lies in an Egyptian coffin. Yet the story of God continues. As we gather, we are reminded of our connection with this story. We are reminded that God’s grace comes to fruition through the work of Jesus. As we connect and live in story of God, we are transformed.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Permanent Grace</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/11/05/permanent-grace"/>
 		<updated>2012-11-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/11/05/permanent-grace</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever received an undeserved gift? Was it difficult to accept? Did you envision someone showing up and taking it away? Perhaps it was hard to believe it could be yours? A few weeks ago, we took a group of teenagers to South Haven, Michigan for the weekend. We rented a couple of cabins attached to a bed and breakfast. Christy and I were able to spend time talking to one of the couples staying in the bed and breakfast. The man shared the story of winning a car. He entered a drawing; his name was announced on the radio. Friends called him to notify him of his fortune. He described peering at the prize in disbelief. Did this really happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not experienced this dynamic. But I could imagine a too-good-to-be-true feeling accompanying such a win. Maybe they will discover that it was a mistake; they will reclaim the prize and life will be as it should. We all have a tendency for skepticism when we get what we do not deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final chapter of Genesis, Joseph&amp;rsquo;s brothers experience this sort of cynicism. While they have experienced tremendous grace and provision, it is hard to believe that Joseph&amp;rsquo;s forgiveness is permanent. When Jacob dies, they expect justice to prevail. Joseph will finally get even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 50:15 NIV)  When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They fear Joseph. Unwilling to speak to Joseph face to face, they send a message. Like a teenager breaking up with a boyfriend by sending a text message, they nervously ask Joseph for forgiveness. You might remember the earlier conversation between Joseph and his brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 45:5 NIV) And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph understands his destiny as ordained by God. He is not planning retribution. In fact, their message causes Joseph to weep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 50:17 NIV) When their message came to him, Joseph wept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brother&amp;rsquo;s mistrust was painful. While he offered elaborate exoneration, his brothers doubted the permanence of his grace. They did not get it. They struggled to accept what they did not deserve. Joseph responds as he did earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 50:20 NIV) You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us struggle to receive God&amp;rsquo;s grace. Even when we are able to accept what we do not deserve, we secretly wonder if our accounts will be audited. Will God decide to take a closer look and change His mind about us. We are like the brothers in this story. Yet, God&amp;rsquo;s grace is not temporary. The author of Hebrews reminds us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Hebrews 10: 23) Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God will not change his mind. Shifting circumstances will not alter His body broken for us nor his blood shed for us. May we learn, like Joseph&amp;rsquo;s brothers, to live in God&amp;rsquo;s permanent love for us. May we rest in the reality of his unchanging, undeserved, unconditional and absolute forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Family Tree</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/10/29/family-tree"/>
 		<updated>2012-10-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/10/29/family-tree</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I had an opportunity to connect with a bit of my family history. Dawson, Levi and I were traveling in the countryside of Georgia; we were on our way back from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshairbarbecue.com/&quot; title=&quot;Home - Fresh Air Barbeque&quot;&gt;Fresh Air BBQ&lt;/a&gt; in Jackson. We passed my great-grandfather&amp;rsquo;s farm which sparked my interest in my lineage. We stopped by the land, walked around and even came across an old family cemetery. On that same visit to Georgia, my uncle gave me a copy of a written history of this land. It was fascinating to explore this story. While the story was filled with details, including specific dates, people and even copies of their wills, reading it raised my curiosity. I wondered how the various family lines developed. I wondered about the siblings. Where did they end up? Were there untold stories of love, war, romance, tragedy? How did their lives play out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we come to the final chapters of Genesis, we are given insight into the lineage of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s sons. On his deathbed, Jacob blesses his sons and prophesies about their descendants. We are reminded that Genesis is not an isolated story; it is the base for the remaining story of Scripture. It is the foundation for the people of God. The story does not end with the final verse of Genesis; it continues and includes many twists and turns. Eventually, the story includes Jesus&amp;rsquo;s arrival; His life, death and resurrection is the pinnacle of the story that begins in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we gather at the Table to remember Jesus&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice for us this week, we are reminded that God was planning His work all the way back in Genesis. We are reminded that our lives are impacted by a larger story. We are included in this story as we live in God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom. May we fall in love with God&amp;rsquo;s story. May we yearn to learn and live in His story. May we consider our role in His story and how our lives impact generations that follow us.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we near the conclusion of the book of Genesis, Jacob is near death. Joseph and his sons pay a visit to his ailing father. Jacob’s actions of adopting and blessing his grandsons remind us that God often moves in surprising ways. As we learn to follow God, we discover that He often acts and moves in ways that we would not plan. Genesis 48&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Surprise</title>

 		<id>/blog/2012/10/22/surprise</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When is the last time you experienced a surprise? When did things turn out in a way different from what you expected? A few weeks ago, Dawson, Levi and I made a trip to Springfield, Illinois. Levi and Dawson wanted to attempt the Joe Rogers Chili Challenge (it was featured on Travel Channel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.travelchannel.com/tv-shows/man-v-food&quot; title=&quot;Man v. Food : TV Shows : Travel Channel&quot;&gt;Man vs. Food&lt;/a&gt;). You have to eat one bowl of Firebrand Chili and you get your name posted on the wall. It is no easy feat. To my surprise, both Dawson and Levi completed the challenge. Levi astonishingly was the youngest to ever complete the challenge. You can watch a video of Dawson &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1ETfUFNvC8&amp;amp;amp;feature=plcp&quot; title=&quot;Dawson eating Joe Rogers - YouTube&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Levi &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io1h9aT6iGo&amp;amp;amp;feature=plcp&quot; title=&quot;Levi at Joe Rogers chili - YouTube&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I was surprised at how it all turned out. I thought I would be encouraging the boy&amp;rsquo;s effort as we walked out; yet we left celebrating their victory over the Firebrand Chili.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s text leaves us surprised. Jacob is near death and ready to bless his sons. As you may know, it was common practice to bless the oldest son, passing on the family name, land and leadership. Yet Jacob has an alternative plan. As we have seen before, God likes to mix it up; His ways are unpredictable. Join us on Sunday as we walk though Genesis 48 together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on this story, we are reminded that God&amp;rsquo;s calling cannot be mapped out. We are challenged with a willingness for flexibility. We are often adverse to change, unwilling to carry out ministry in a different way. Maybe God would surprise our methods with new callings. May we consistently be open to God&amp;rsquo;s surprises. May we be willing to follow him into the unknown, the difficult, the new.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Cultural Changes</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/10/18/cultural-changes"/>
 		<updated>2012-10-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/10/18/cultural-changes</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are living in a transitional period of time in the life of First Baptist Church Muncie. In many ways, we find ourselves in a drastically different world. Muncie is not the same city that it was 50 years ago; the world is not the same world. We have moved from being in the center of the community to being on the fringes. I am not talking about geographically, but culturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who&amp;rsquo;ve been around a while, you may notice more empty pews these days. This is not a characteristic unique to First Baptist Church Muncie. It&amp;rsquo;s happening all over the country. Thom Rainer tells us that &lt;strong&gt;65%&lt;/strong&gt; of the Builder generation (born before 1946) attends church on a weekly basis.  The next generation (Boomers, born between the years 1946 and 1964) is about&lt;strong&gt; 35%&lt;/strong&gt;. Their kids (Generation X, born generally from the early 60s to the early 80s) attend church at rates around &lt;strong&gt;15%&lt;/strong&gt;. The youngest generation (termed Generation Y, born from the mid 80s on) attends church at about &lt;strong&gt;4%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is mind boggling to see such a drop in church attendance. No doubt, our world is changing. It is clear that we cannot continue to pretend that we exist in 1950. We are called, as a congregation, to navigate these cultural changes as we follow the Spirit of God. In many ways, we are returning to the world much like the early church. We, as the church, are no longer in the center of society. We no longer have the prestige, the power, the privilege of building a big building and watching droves of people flock through our doors. Our posture will need to change; we will have to focus outwardly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of young adults has been discussing the cultural shifts and considering ways to navigate the changes in our world. At the beginning of 2013, a small group will be experimenting with new models of ministry, in order to reach our community with the message of Christ. I hope that each of you will pray that God will direct First Baptist Church Muncie as we respond to God&amp;rsquo;s leading. I am sure that God will resource this congregation to fulfill His calling. You will hear more of these experimental ministries in the coming months. I mentioned them now so that you will join me in praying for God&amp;rsquo;s leading as we plan.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Jealousy</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/10/15/jealousy"/>
 		<updated>2012-10-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/10/15/jealousy</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be jealous? Sometimes you read of a jealous boyfriend or girlfriend. They are careful about their significant other; they don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone else to share in their relationship. Other times you hear of jealous siblings. They find joy in the failures of their brothers and sisters. Somehow, they feel as though they are lifted up when others fall. Surely, jealousy is a sin. We are reminded in Scripture to exhibit an attitude of gratefulness in contrast to jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of jealousy is a forgetfulness of what we have been given. We focus on what others have received, neglecting our own gifts. We also use the word envy to describe such behavior. We speak of someone as “green with envy” when they are upset by the fortune of another. We have all felt this way at one time or another. Maybe it was a job promotion for a coworker or a successful test score for a sibling. We are unable to celebrate the good in their life because we are upset that we did not receive. When we harbor such feelings, we fail to be grateful for the gifts that God has given us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s story, Joseph&amp;rsquo;s brothers relocate to Egypt in order to survive the famine. Significant grace is extended and spite of their previous failures. They had sold their brother into slavery; they did not deserve to be rescued. But in this story, they are given another chance to respond. Joseph blesses his brothers with new clothes. Again, they receive what they do not deserve. But they will be tested. Benjamin receives five new garments. As before, favoritism is given to one brother. How will be other brothers respond? Twenty years earlier, they responded with jealousy and sold the privileged brother into slavery. Joseph knows their tendency. He warns them,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 45:24 NIV) &amp;hellip; Don’t quarrel on the way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems kind of crazy that this would be a possibility. They had been given far more than they deserved. Grace has been extended to them. Why would they quarrel? They should be celebrating. But when we stop and think about it, we have all reacted in this way at one time or another. Our tendency is to focus on what we do not have rather than what we have been given. Our tendency is to be jealous of our siblings, our coworkers, our neighbors. This story is a reminder to choose gratefulness over jealousy. It is a reminder that we have been given what we do not deserve. We have no reason to be jealous, to be envious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we delve into this week&amp;rsquo;s story, may we be reminded of our own propensity to focus on what others have received. May we be reminded of the tremendous grace that God has given each of us through Jesus Christ. And may this grace overpower our temptation to focus on what others have received.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Office Hours</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/10/09/office-hours"/>
 		<updated>2012-10-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/10/09/office-hours</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, my son&amp;rsquo;s friend (a middle schooler) asked me a question. Knowing that I am a pastor, he wondered about my work week. &amp;ldquo;What do you do all week?,&amp;rdquo; he asked, &amp;ldquo;Do you clean the church or something?&amp;rdquo; He pictured me sitting in my office during the week with little to do. Maybe vacuuming the sanctuary or cleaning windows would keep me from getting too bored. While we may laugh at this kid&amp;rsquo;s honesty, perhaps some of you wonder how I spend my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is honest to say that I never run out of work. Many high-profile pastors have struggled with issues of life and time management. Some have neglected their families in light of a &amp;ldquo;higher&amp;rdquo; calling. Others have neglected their bodies, failing to exercise and eat right due to hurried schedules. A few weeks ago, Matt and I spent an entire day outlining our job/ministry descriptions. It became clear that we rarely work a 40 hour week; most of our weeks are 55-60 hours. So what takes up all this time? Why are pastors so busy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Matt and I serve different roles in this congregation, our work patterns are similar. We spend time preparing sermons or planning worship, leading teams of volunteers in ministry, reading current literature on theology and church life, caring for those who are sick or bereaved, communicating (through church publications or blogs), connecting with the larger Muncie community and spending time in relationship with people. Our work day is not 9-to-5, it is unpredictable and we don&amp;rsquo;t always have a weekly pattern. Evening meetings and late night emergency calls sometimes interrupt family time and sleep. Indeed, we have to work hard to keep balance in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may be difficult to define the work of a pastor, the primary purpose of our role is to lead this congregation in following the calling of God in our lives. This may involve conversation in a coffee shop, lunch with someone who is struggling, a visit with a hospital patient, connecting with other church leaders in the community or sequestering for prayer and study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work often needs to take place outside of the church office. Because of the fluctuating nature of our work, it is difficult to predict where we may be at any given time on any given day. If you drive to the church office, you may or may not find us there. Nevertheless, I want you to know that your pastoral staff is accessible. Our cell phone numbers are published in the church bulletin; please feel free to call or text us. We will gladly speak with you on the phone or schedule an appointment. Some may feel hesitant about calling; it may seem that your concern or question is insignificant. Therefore, we are providing a staff contact request form in the church office. Please fill free to fill this out to request a contact with Will, Robert, Matt or myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a 9-to-5 job seems appealing; predictability in schedule offers benefits. However, I love the work that God has called me to. And while I am rarely needed to vacuum or clean windows in the church, I do receive such assignments at home.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Extreme Grace</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/10/01/extreme-grace"/>
 		<updated>2012-10-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/10/01/extreme-grace</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we lived in Springfield, Illinois, a friend (and member of our church) worked on the Governor&amp;rsquo;s staff. I was pleasantly surprised when he offered me and Christy tickets to the Inaugural Ball. It was pretty cool to be involved in a VIP event of this sort. Our coats were taken at the door; we were invited to enjoy an unbelievable display of prime rib, seafood and all kinds of hors d&#39;oeuvres. We were able to dance, feast and rub shoulders with celebrities. We clearly did not belong at the event. I was a youth pastor, not a political supporter. Yet, we enjoyed the elevated treatment for one evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s story, Joseph&amp;rsquo;s brothers make the trek to Egypt in search of food. When they arrive, Joseph recognizes them, but they don&amp;rsquo;t know Joseph. Joseph has a plan. He accuses the brothers of espionage. Terrified, they return home only to find the silver (the money used to buy the grain) in their bags. Now they will be accused of robbery. It seems that everything is going wrong. They interpret their misfortune as God&amp;rsquo;s punishment for selling Joseph into slavery. They are instructed to return with their younger brother, Benjamin. In time, they return because of the severity of the famine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they arrive in Egypt (for the second time), they are frightened, uncertain; they fear they will be enslaved or killed. But their treatment is not what they expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 43:33 NIV) The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could not believe what was happening. In their minds, they deserved death. They sold Joseph into slavery and God was enacting revenge. You could also make the case that Joseph should have taken his chance for retaliation. However, they are invited to feast, to enjoy the plenty in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 43:34 NIV) When portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s. So they feasted and drank freely with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin gets more food, but all the brothers are feasting and drinking freely. This is a beautiful story of grace. The brothers are astonished by such generosity. Their treatment defies fairness. Yet, they receive and are blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we think about this story, we will come to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Table together on Sunday. We are welcomed to a table that we don&amp;rsquo;t deserve. We have experienced an abundant grace that covers our sins. It is crucial that we live in this grace each day. I hope that you can join us on Sunday as we explore this story and remember together the blood shed for us, the body broken for us.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Reliance</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/09/25/reliance"/>
 		<updated>2012-09-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/09/25/reliance</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our culture, we are often told that we can accomplish whatever we want. We simply need to give it enough energy, focus; if we simply work hard enough, it will be ours. While there is merit in such advice, we may want to rethink how we guide our children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s story, Joseph is finally released from prison. His long awaited emancipation comes as a result of dream interpretation skills. His freedom did not come as soon as Joseph may have hoped, but it comes nonetheless. The cupbearer forgot to bring up Joseph&amp;rsquo;s name on his initial release (Gen. 40:23). Yet when Pharaoh experienced dream problems some two years later, he recalls the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 41:12 NIV) Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did Joseph interpret the dreams, but he nailed it. Maybe he would be able to help Pharaoh. So Joseph is cleaned up and brought before the King. Pharaoh tells Joseph his dream and asked him if he would be able to interpret it. I love Joseph&amp;rsquo;s response. It may be a clue as to why God would have chosen Joseph. Look at how Joseph responds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 41:16 NIV) “I cannot do it,” Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse is key. Joseph does not strut in, celebrating his ability to interpret dreams. He humbly confesses that he is incapable without God&amp;rsquo;s assistance. Joseph is reliant on God&amp;rsquo;s power. Joseph&amp;rsquo;s dependence on God models the proper posture for you and me. God does incredible things through Joseph. In fact, in one day he goes from a prisoner to second in command in Egypt. One might chalk up the success to Joseph&amp;rsquo;s ability. Yet the author of Genesis credits his humility and willingness to be used by God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharaoh notices that Joseph has an intense connection with God. He wants someone like this in charge during the prophesied famine. Pharaoh says to Joseph,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 41:39 NIV) Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt that Pharaoh understood Joseph&amp;rsquo;s connection with God. Yet he understands that Joseph operates out of a power not his own. He senses Joseph&amp;rsquo;s ability to remain dependent on God. In a world where self-esteem and self-promotion are valued, may we learn to rely on God. May we learn to exhibit the posture of Joseph. May we confess our inability as we seek God&amp;rsquo;s ability to do the impossible through us.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Disappointed</title>

 		<id>/blog/2012/09/17/disappointed</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I hate going to the grocery store on my way home from work. Long lines are common at this time of the day. I guess everyone waits until they are heading home from work to stop by the store. You have to stand there and wait! The magazines at the checkout counter may entertain for short time; but after a bit, I find myself impatient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is waiting so hard? It seems partly because we live in a world of instant gratification. We can grab dinner without ever having to emerge from our vehicle. If our order is incorrect and we have to walk into the restaurant, we are irate. In a busy and hurried world, waiting is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our story this week, we find Joseph in prison. You may remember that he is incarcerated for allegedly raping Potiphar&amp;rsquo;s wife. Unjustly accused, his time in prison must have tested his patience. In time, Joseph encounters two men disturbed by dreams. The cupbearer and the baker are two of Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s trusted servants. We are not sure how they ended up in prison, but they must have offended Pharaoh in some way. Joseph, in charge of all the prisoners, has an opportunity to get to know these men. God gives him the ability to interpret their troublesome dreams. For one, the dream meant freedom; for the other, it meant death. As the cupbearer finds freedom, it seems Joseph&amp;rsquo;s will get his ticket out of prison. Yet we read,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 40:23 NIV) The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must have been a stunning disappointment for Joseph. It seemed that God had given him the ability to interpret the cupbearer&amp;rsquo;s dream so that he would be granted freedom. It appeared that God was moving Joseph toward freedom. Yet Joseph finds himself let down and questioning God&amp;rsquo;s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of us who know the end of the story, we are okay with Joseph being in prison a bit longer. But for Joseph, dismay and doubt must have ruled his thoughts. You see, he did not know the story&amp;rsquo;s ending. He had no idea what God was going to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and I often find ourselves in this place. Perhaps we&amp;rsquo;re disappointed because God isn&amp;rsquo;t providing in the way we imagined. Maybe a job application was refused, a scholarship was denied or medical report returned ominous results. We are left questioning, doubting or disappointed. In times like these, we must learn to trust the One who sees the future, the One who determines all things. Joseph&amp;rsquo;s story reminds us that God&amp;rsquo;s timing is perfect. May we learn to trust as we wait on God. May we learn that He has our best interests in mind. He is faithful, no matter our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Joseph</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/09/10/Joseph"/>
 		<updated>2012-09-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/09/10/Joseph</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to church to know story of Joseph. Popular Broadway musicals have familiarized Americans with the main characters of the story. Last year, we attended a local production of &lt;em&gt;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&lt;/em&gt;. I remember having to hide my 7-year-old&amp;rsquo;s eyes during the scene with Potipher&amp;rsquo;s wife. No doubt, the story is anything but boring. As we come to chapter 39 this week, we delve into the real life circumstances of Joseph. While he finds himself in an advantageous situation as a caretaker in Potipher&amp;rsquo;s house, he is challenged with the advances of Potipher&amp;rsquo;s promiscuous wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is easy to see the pitfalls of engaging in an adulterous relationship with your boss&amp;rsquo;s wife, one could argue that it was in Joseph&amp;rsquo;s best interest to meet her demands. In fact, Joseph was a slave. He could have easily justified giving into the owner&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rsquo;s orders. But Joseph had other reasons for rejecting her advances. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t simply that she was unattractive. Joseph was primarily concerned with his relationship with God. His response was,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 39:9 NIV) How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph was solely concerned with how his actions would measure up to God&amp;rsquo;s standard. His chief consideration was to remain obedient and faithful to God. Even so, you might think that such high moral standards would be rewarded. Perhaps Potiphar would promote Joseph for his impeccable judgment. Maybe God would grant Joseph freedom for continual obedience, day after day. After all, Joseph was doing the right thing. How could anything go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you read the story, you find that Joseph actions land him in prison. Potiphar&amp;rsquo;s wife accuses Joseph of rape and when it is Joseph&amp;rsquo;s word against hers, Potiphar believes his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we consider the story, we often find ourselves in similar lures. Maybe our temptations are not so direct (we probably don&amp;rsquo;t have someone asking us to sleep with them every day). But we face temptations nonetheless. Fudging an expense report or relating a couple of mistruths might be considered &amp;ldquo;just part of the job.&amp;rdquo; And when we refuse to participate, we are penalized. How do we deal with similar enticements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not always easy, we have to go back to Joseph&amp;rsquo;s focus. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t considering how his behavior might impact his job or standing in Potiphar&amp;rsquo;s house. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t weighing the reaction of Potiphar&amp;rsquo;s wife. He was simply focused on God, on God&amp;rsquo;s Word. And when he measured his potential behavior against God&amp;rsquo;s standards, the choice was easy. He was not willing to sin against God. In this case, it cost Joseph dearly. For the next several years, he may have wondered what life would be like if he had made a different choice. But in the end, God was faithful to reward Joseph&amp;rsquo;s action (or in this case, lack of action). As we face our own decisions, our own temptations, may we remember that the right decision doesn&amp;rsquo;t always produce favorable outcomes (at least initially). But as we follow God&amp;rsquo;s leading, we can be certain that God will be faithful to those who faithfully follow his commands.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Struggle</title>

 		<id>/blog/2012/08/13/Struggle</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jacob&amp;rsquo;s story is quite remarkable. As a baby coming out of his mothers womb, he is grabbing the heel of his brother. He spends most of life scheming and conniving; he gets his brother&amp;rsquo;s birthright and blessing, his uncle Laban&amp;rsquo;s daughters (he really only wanted one of them) and now significant possessions of animals, servants, etc. Maybe Jacob is ready to retire and enjoy fishing and playing golf. But God is not finished with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that God called his grandfather Abraham, God now issues instructions to Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 31:3 NIV)  Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some dispute about Jacob&amp;rsquo;s integrity. Laban&amp;rsquo;s sons accuse him of cheating his father-in-law. This would not be out of character for Jacob. Perhaps it is all a matter of timing; Jacob decides to follow God&amp;rsquo;s calling and return to the land of his father Isaac. There is one problem. Esau. The last time they talked, Esau was bitter, angry and ready to kill Jacob. Twenty years have passed; has Esau forgiven Jacob? How will this all work out? Jacob must have been nervous. Yet God promised to be with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Jacob meets a group of angels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 32:1 NIV) Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They help Jacob scout out the situation with Esau. The initial reports are not good for Jacob. Esau has 400 men and is heading his way. This tension sets the context for this week&amp;rsquo;s study. Jacob divides his family into two camps and spends the night alone. During the night, he has a personal encounter with God. We are told,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 32:24 NIV) a man wrestled with him till daybreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun rises, Jacob is sure that this man is God himself. While Jacob&amp;rsquo;s entire life had been one of wrestling, struggling, this encounter is significant for him. This intimate encounter with God will change everything. He will now have a new name, a new outlook on life. Jacob&amp;rsquo;s relationship with God has been up and down. We have seen him worship, tithe (Genesis 28). Yet life patterns of deception, trickery often prevail. In this overnight struggle, God subdues Jacob and Jacob is blessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us have wrestled with God on some level. We grapple to overcome sin and faithfully follow a God who gave himself for us. Join us on Sunday as we explore the story of Jacob wrestling with God.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Tables Turned</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/08/06/Tables-Turned"/>
 		<updated>2012-08-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/08/06/Tables-Turned</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s story is anything but boring. Our study through Genesis has been full of twists and turns, faith, deceit, love, rejection, pain, sorrow, miracles and rejoicing. We sometimes find ourselves identifying with one or more characters in the story. This week&amp;rsquo;s story includes quite the cast. For the last few weeks, we have been following Jacob. So far, he has been anything but impressive (in terms of faith). He has deceived his brother and father; he escapes to his uncle&amp;rsquo;s house to avoid getting killed. This week, we pick up with his arrival in his homeland. Little does Jacob know that God is about to turn the table. The trickster is about to be tricked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacob falls in love with a beautiful girl named Rachel. Her father promised her hand in marriage in exchange for seven years of work. The story is one of patience, endurance and love. We read,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 29:20 NIV) So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe life was going to be OK for Jacob. Sure, he lied to his father and brother, but who&amp;rsquo;s perfect, right? Yet God has not forgotten his scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wedding night is a highly anticipated event. You can imagine how intense the excitement must have been for Jacob; he had been engaged seven years. Most engagements in our culture range from six months to 3 years. Finally, the big day arrives. Rachel&amp;rsquo;s father (Laban) throws a party; everyone celebrates. But at some point, Laban substitutes his eldest daughter. We aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly sure when Jacob figures it out. The text simply tells us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 29:25 NIV) When morning came, there was Leah!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we explore this story in detail on Sunday, we discover the tables turned. Jacob, the deceiver, is deceived. There are many facets to this story, a modern-day soap opera would have to compete for such drama. But in the end, God is doing his work. He is forming a people from this twisted bunch. He is forming his man Jacob into the person He has called him to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a few minutes, listen to Rich Mullins&#39; take on this story and please join us on Sunday as we engage Scripture together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>God's Timetable</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/07/23/God%27s-Timetable"/>
 		<updated>2012-07-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/07/23/God's-Timetable</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was working on this Sunday&amp;rsquo;s sermon. I had lunch scheduled with a friend; he has been a pastor for many years. I spent the morning doing research and studying the passage. When I broke for lunch, my friend and I spent some time talking about this story. One verse puzzled me, or at least  caused me to doubt my memory. I did not remember it being in the Bible. When I asked my friend about it, he confessed the same lack of memory. A few weeks later, I was asked to lead a devotion at a denominational gathering. In a room with about ten other pastors, I shared the same verse. Following the devotional, several of the pastors admitted the same failure to recall this detail. So here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many stories of barren women in the Bible. The more famous include Hannah and Sarah. Their heartache and sense of failure cannot be overemphasized. A woman&amp;rsquo;s value was strongly connected with her ability to reproduce. We all remember these powerful stories of God providing for these women. What I did not recall was that Rebekah was also barren. Do you remember last week&amp;rsquo;s story? Abraham&amp;rsquo;s servant traveled to a distant land (Abraham&amp;rsquo;s home country) and finds Rebekah. She is a beautiful virgin seemingly picked by God as Isaac&amp;rsquo;s wife. Miraculously her family agrees to release her to Isaac. It seemed that the promise of Abraham&amp;rsquo;s great nation would be fulfilled. But here is the kicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 25:21 NIV) Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just one sentence; the author of Genesis does not dwell on her suffering. In the same verse, we are quickly told,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 25:21 NIV) The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is why we did not recollect this detail; it happens so fast in the text. But if you look a bit deeper, you realize that Isaac was 40 years old when he marries Rebekah; he is 60 when the twins are born. Twenty years of praying; twenty years of questioning God. How could we have missed this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt like God was oblivious to your suffering? Have you ever wondered if God hears your prayers? Have you felt like you misread God&amp;rsquo;s direction in a given decision? Isaac must have questioned if Rebekah was the right choice. Rebekah must have doubted her decision to leave her family. For twenty years, they prayed for God to move, to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we prepare for Sunday&amp;rsquo;s text, it is worth noting that God&amp;rsquo;s timetable is not always the same as ours. God may seem to be silent, inactive or insensitive; yet we can be assured that He is not. We are not sure why He allowed Isaac and Rebekah to wait for so long. Yet Isaac continued to exhibit faith in God&amp;rsquo;s plan; he prayed for a child. May we remember this detail and not lose sight of this truth as we wait on God.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Seeking God's Direction</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/07/17/Seeking-God%27s-Direction"/>
 		<updated>2012-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/07/17/Seeking-God's-Direction</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we step into the month of August, we are nearing the one year mark of our discernment process regarding church staffing. In August 2011, church leaders (a combined team of Church Council and Diaconate) entered a process of discerning; the question was future staffing at First Baptist Church. We embarked on a journey that took us through several activities (a prayer vigil, listening sessions, exploring outside sources and deliberation among leaders). The leadership team concluded that God was leading us toward an additional staff person who would have broad responsibilities; yet his/her focus would be in outreach and worship. This decision was presented to the congregation in October. A consensus vote revealed overwhelming support for this direction. Last winter, a search team was formed to identify a candidate to fill the position. The search team has been working for months surveying profiles, contacting potential candidates and interviewing candidates. They have taken their work seriously; they have offered their best to determine God&amp;rsquo;s leading in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these efforts have led to a unanimous recommendation. The search team is proposing that we hire Matt Headley as Associate Pastor at First Baptist. Matt has been active in pursuing God&amp;rsquo;s direction over the past few months. In the meantime, an opportunity for outreach with Youth for Christ was presented to him last month. After contemplating the options and conversing with Matt, the search committee has determined that Matt serving &amp;frac34; time at First Baptist and &amp;frac14; time with Youth for Christ will benefit everyone. On August 12, the membership will have an opportunity to vote on this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision has not been in haste; it has taken almost a year to complete. The committee has followed a spiritual discernment process as they have deliberated, and members of the congregation have had input as well. As the church body is asked to finalize the calling of an Associate Pastor in the coming weeks, I want you all to be assured of the due diligence of this team and in the process they have authentically sought and indeed sensed God&amp;rsquo;s leading in this decision.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Listening to God</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/07/16/Listening-to-God"/>
 		<updated>2012-07-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/07/16/Listening-to-God</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been asked to pull off the impossible? Maybe your boss wanted delivery on an unfeasible time table. Perhaps your spouse requested an unimaginable home project. Completion seemed absurd; but you stepped up and gave it a shot. In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, Abraham asks his servant to locate a wife for Isaac in another country, Abraham&amp;rsquo;s home country. Is there any way that a woman would leave her homeland to join this family in such uncertainty? It is a long shot; yet he ventures into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story offers a model for our own endeavors. The servant is prayerful and dependent on God as he makes his way to Aram Naharaim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 24:12 NIV) O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without recounting the entire story, he experiences God&amp;rsquo;s leading him to the right woman. When he conveys his experience to her family, they also agree that God is working. Her father and brother respond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 24:50 NIV) This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final encounter gives Rebekah an opportunity to back out of the deal. Her response matches that of her family; she is faithful to follow God&amp;rsquo;s leading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 24:57-58 NIV) Then they said, “Let’s call the girl and ask her about it.” So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” “I will go,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the chief characteristics of this account is a retelling of God&amp;rsquo;s movement. The servant tells the story to Rebekah&amp;rsquo;s family; they discern that God is moving. When the servant meets Isaac after his return, he tells him the story. Again and again, the decision is not based on their preferences; it is based on God&amp;rsquo;s movement. God acts; they respond. God directs; they obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often our decisions are based on our individual preferences. We want a particular outcome and so we proceed in our desired direction. We seldom pay attention to God&amp;rsquo;s promptings. We sometimes ask the wrong questions. As we discern, may we emulate the posture of Abraham&amp;rsquo;s servant. Prayer, listening, worship and recounting our experience are part of the mix. May we ask, &amp;ldquo;How is God leading us?&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;What do we want to accomplish?&amp;rdquo; May we be willing to submit our will to His will. May we live out obedience as we hear the voice of God.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Laughter</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/07/02/Laughter"/>
 		<updated>2012-07-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/07/02/Laughter</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Laughter is a good thing, right? Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy a good laugh. We watch sit-coms with virtually no plot-line for the sake of a laugh. We are entertained by comedians who relate the ordinariness of life; they make us chuckle. But laughter can also be very damaging. A group of uncaring school kids can inflict intense agony with their giggles. In this week&amp;rsquo;s text, we find two dimensions of laughter. The first is the laughter of doubt. The second is that of overwhelming surprise and joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to bite off a large chunk of Scripture this week. While it is impossible to cover every aspect of the story, we will move quickly through chapters 17-20. God affirms His promise to Abraham and Sarah by changing their names and giving them a specific timeline. Three mysterious visitors show up; Abraham and Sarah provide hospitality to them. While they are eating, God speaks; He offer specifics,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 18:10 NIV) I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah overhears the conversation; she cannot hold it in. She bursts out with laughter. This is the kind of chuckling that comes when you hear the unbelievable. God is not pleased with her response. He questions her outburst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 18:15 NIV) Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t fool God; He hears it all. The next few scenes do not bolster Abraham nor Sarah&amp;rsquo;s reputation. Laughing at God&amp;rsquo;s promise is followed by excusing the sins of a corrupt city (Sodom and Gomorrah) and lying to this guy named Abimelech about their marriage. You have to wonder why God picked this couple. By the time you get to Genesis 21, you are doubting if God chose the right people. We then read,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 21:1 NIV) Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what he had promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you believe it? God came through; He did the impossible. Even though He is dealing with a doubtful couple of liars, He does what He says He will do. I find Sarah&amp;rsquo;s response intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 21:6 NIV) Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a different kind of laughter. She no longer doubts God, but giggles with joy at what He has done. Her laughter is extended to everyone who hears this story. We are smiling at God&amp;rsquo;s grace, His provision, His willingness to use the unlikely for His purposes. Do we find ourselves laughing with doubt that God could transform the unlikely situations of our lives? May we be reminded as we encounter this story of God&amp;rsquo;s transformation of our laughter; may we be left smiling in astonishment at His movement in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Following God's Way</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/06/25/Following-God%27s-Way"/>
 		<updated>2012-06-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/06/25/Following-God's-Way</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We talked this week about what it means to follow God&amp;rsquo;s leading into the unknown. As we studied Genesis 12, we remembered times in own lives when God called us into the unseen. Abraham was required to leave his family, his country, to give up his inheritance in response to God&amp;rsquo;s promptings. We admire his faith, his willingness to trust God. Yet, we cannot forget that Abraham&amp;rsquo;s life is full of ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, David Jones will be teaching on the story of Ishmael. While Abraham was faithful to follow God into distant lands, he and Sarah are not sure God will be able to fulfill his promise through an old barren lady. They develop their own plan; maybe God needs a little help. It seems logical; using maidservants to produce children was an acceptable practice in the ancient Middle East. So Sarah brings it up and Abraham willingly participates in the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever imagine people like Abraham and Sarah walking around with halos? Do you envision them as nearly perfect in their relating to God? This is simply not the case. The author of Genesis reveals the raw truth. Abraham and Sarah were not convinced that the barren womb could be opened. They chose a path apart from God&amp;rsquo;s leading; they took matters into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are often tempted to do the same. We like to strategize; we would rather go the reasonable path. We are often skeptical that God will step up to the plate. In fact, God often seems slow to action. In this case, Abraham and Sarah complicate God&amp;rsquo;s plan. Their veering has tremendous consequences for all involved. As David relates the story, may we be challenged to submit to God&amp;rsquo;s way. May we recognize that His plan is worth trusting.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Stepping Out</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/06/18/Stepping-Out"/>
 		<updated>2012-06-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/06/18/Stepping-Out</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was four years ago this summer that our family responded to a call to pastor this church. It was not an easy decision for us. In fact, we had recently (less than a year prior) purchased a new home in Springfield, Illinois with the intention of remaining there. You might recall that I dismissed your first contact; I threw away the carefully chosen materials sent to me by the search team. Yet in time, God revealed that He &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; calling me to Muncie. Moving to a new state required our kids to leave their friends, their church family, the only community that they could remember; they would have to make new friends in a strange place. I was not eager for our family to make this sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years later, I am more convinced than ever that it was God&amp;rsquo;s plan for us to relocate to Muncie. I could not plan nor foresee what God was going to do with us in Muncie. While He is far from finished, He has allowed us to join this congregation as it moves into its future. I am pleased with the progress we have made; I look forward to leading this congregation in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our text this week is about a man who was also called to leave his home. His leaving was far more extensive than mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 12:1 NIV) The LORD had said to Abram, “Leave your country, your people and your father’s household and go to the land I will show you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abram&amp;rsquo;s leaving required him to leave everything that defined him. He gave up his home, his inheritance and his extended family to follow God. It must have been tremendously challenging. Yet Abram did exactly what God instructed. God&amp;rsquo;s bidding came with a promise; God promised to increase Abram&amp;rsquo;s name and make a great nation from his descendants. There was one problem; Abram&amp;rsquo;s wife was barren. How was God going to work this out? Was he luring Abram down a dead end road? To make matters worse, when Abram arrived in the &lt;em&gt;promised&lt;/em&gt; land, it was inhabited by pagan people with fortified cities. How would his descendants (if there were any) inherit this land? No doubt, Abram was walking into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we study this text on Sunday, we are also challenged to exhibit the same trust in God&amp;rsquo;s leading. God often calls us without giving us all the information. God frequently requires strong dependence on Him. He seldom makes these transitions easy. As we examine the calling of Abram, we will consider ways in which God may be requiring us to &lt;em&gt;step out&lt;/em&gt; in faith.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Fathers</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/06/11/Fathers"/>
 		<updated>2012-06-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/06/11/Fathers</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been asked to read Scripture in a small group Bible study. While some get nervous reading anything in front of others, the Bible can be particularly challenging; it has its share of difficult words. The historical books in the Old Testament are probably the worst, especially the lists of family names. We come to one of those lists (they are called genealogies) this week. It would certainly be hard to preach a sermon over a list of names; yet these lists remind us of a greater truth. None of us live on a historical island. We are connected to our family lineage, both predecessors and offspring. We are products of our fathers and we have the potential to impact our children. It just so happens that this Sunday is Father&amp;rsquo;s Day. Do you see the connection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would not have the time to relate each story embodied in this list of names. Yet the list reminds us that we have fathers who have shaped us. Some of us share wonderful memories of men who have transformed us in countless ways. We celebrate dads who poured themselves into our lives. Yet every story is not a Pollyanna account; our fathers have not always contributed in positive ways. Father&amp;rsquo;s Day is a painful day for some. Disappointment, regret, hurt and pain characterize our understanding of father. We are a community with various experiences; it is good to share our stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we will use Genesis 11 as a springboard into a discussion on fatherhood. Instead of flipping past the list, relegating any relevance to our lives, we will communicate various experiences of our family lines. At the same time, we will challenge modern day fathers to leave a legacy for future generations. We are living in a list, the ink has not yet dried. Finally, we will point to God as ultimate Father. He is the perfect example of what it means to relate to our children. Where there is brokenness and heartbreak, His love heals. Join us on Father&amp;rsquo;s Day for a time of collective celebration and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Tall Buildings</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/06/05/Tall-Buildings"/>
 		<updated>2012-06-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/06/05/Tall-Buildings</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We spent this past weekend in Chicago; my kids wanted to ride the Ferris wheel on Navy Pier at night. They wanted to experience overlooking the lights of the city. We had several commitments throughout the weekend, including worshiping at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Chicago (what a great experience!), that kept us occupied during the evening hours. We finished at Antioch at 9:40 pm on Sunday; the Navy Pier closes at 10 p.m. We rushed across town to ride the Ferris wheel and filled the final carriage for the evening. As we exited the pier, the Sea Dog Boat Cruise worker approached us. She offered an extreme discount for the final tour of the evening. Even though it was nearly 11 p.m., we decided to take the 75 minute architectural tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we floated down the Chicago River, we were overwhelmed by engineering feats of the last hundred years. The river itself was reversed for sanitation reasons; the project resulted in the connecting of Lake Michigan to the Mississippi basin. Two of world&amp;rsquo;s tallest buildings are visible from the river. The newer Trump Tower actually touches the river; a special cement was developed to keep the weight of the building from sinking into the river. The infamous Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is a highlight of the tour. Dozens of other buildings tower the 38 moveable bridges. We were certainly in awe of such grandeur. As we maneuvered back toward the pier, I remembered that I was preaching on Genesis 11 this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 11:4 NIV) Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world of such city-builders looking to make a name for themselves. In fact, we celebrate efforts that break records. The Trump Tower was scaled down after the 2001 attacks; previously it was slated as the world&amp;rsquo;s tallest building. So what is so bad about building tall buildings? Why was God not pleased with man&amp;rsquo;s tenacity for accomplishment in Genesis 11? Why does he break up the party at Babel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we will explore the misfortune of Babel. Mankind was striving for security apart from God, he was looking for notoriety based on his own achievement. God steps in and redirects him toward His purposes. I hope you will join us as we delve into this ancient story. May we consider our own striving for independence and fame apart from God.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Search Team Update</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/05/22/Search-Team-Update"/>
 		<updated>2012-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/05/22/Search-Team-Update</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we move past Memorial Day, the swimming pools open and the kids get out of school; summer is here. Schedules slow down a bit or get more hectic, depending on who you are. People begin to travel and weekly church programs become a little more sparse. Yet the work of one team at First Baptist continues strong; the Associate Pastor Search Team is not going on break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of their work needs to remain confidential, I would like to assure everyone that the team considers their work of tremendous importance. They are fulfilling the mandate of a church-wide decision from last year. As you might remember, a group of church leaders (including the church council and diaconate) participated in a discernment process regarding church staffing in August 2011. They explored options and looked at other church models, entered a purposeful time of listening (this involved a 24 hour prayer vigil as well as small group discussions with various groups throughout the church) and examined the leading of the Spirit. The leaders felt that God was directing us toward the hiring of an associate pastor with major responsibilities in worship and outreach. This is in contrast to hiring a specialized staff person for music, youth, children, Christian Education or missions. As First Baptist no longer has the resources to hire multiple specialists for specific ministries, the leaders sensed that a broadly focused associate pastor would give the church the needed leadership to function as the people of God, carrying out the ministries of the church in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, this decision was presented to the congregation in an evening meeting. The broader congregation affirmed the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s movement among the leaders. No doubt, this implementation of this model for church staffing will require adjustment. We will no longer have specific staff for particular ministries; we will have two full-time pastors inspiring, empowering and equipping teams to carry out ministry. The responsibilities for each pastor will be beyond one person&amp;rsquo;s capability if they were to do the ministry on their own, yet this approach enables the congregation to take ownership of various ministries. In many ways, the people of the church will be doing the work of the church; this is in contrast to the staff doing the work of the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Search Team has been working with denominational leaders as well as reaching out to two seminaries and two Christian universities to discern God&amp;rsquo;s plan for the person to fill this position. The team has also interviewed Matt Headley, recognizing Matt as a strong candidate for the position. Please know that this team is giving due diligence to this process. The team may be prepared to make a recommendation to the church later in the summer. Please continue to pray for their steadfast work. As they discern the leading of the Spirit for the entire congregation, their work is essential for our health and vitality as a church.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>God Regretting</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/05/21/God-Regretting"/>
 		<updated>2012-05-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/05/21/God-Regretting</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On June 3, I will be in Chicago for graduation; Matt will be preaching. He will deal with a fairly familiar passage, the story of Noah. However, there are a few verses in Genesis 6 preceding the story of Noah; they set the stage for the epic story. We often breeze past these verses to get to the good part. Yet these verses reveal the reason for the flood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other accounts of the flood are found in ancient Mesopotamian literature. One account is the Epic of Gilgamesh. This account portrays a man named Utnapishtim who builds an ark, loads it with animals and survives a violent storm. The pagan account describes gods who are fed up with mortals; they seek to destroy them by sending a flood. The only survivor (Utnapishtim) is tipped off; he escapes the plan of the gods and becomes immortal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some may find these accounts disturbing, they seem to confirm the validity of the biblical account. As we read the text on Sunday, you may be surprised by them. In some ways they sound more like Greek mythology than scripture. Yet they reveal the heart of God at this point in history. While Utnapishtim escapes the plot of the gods (he was never intended to survive), Noah is chosen by God to carry on the human race. But before we get to his story, it is appropriate to live in the tension of God&amp;rsquo;s decision. Before Noah was chosen, God considered total annihilation. Like the gods in the Epic of Gilgamesh, God considered ridding the world of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we read these verses, we feel God&amp;rsquo;s pain. God regrets creating man. That is pretty astounding. How can God regret? Is it possible for God to show remorse for his actions? Yet we read (ESV translation),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 6:7 ESV) for I am sorry that I have made them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did God feel this way? What could possibly have prompted God to say this? Join us on Sunday as we explore the reason for the flood. We will consider possible parallels to our own world today and contemplate our appropriate response to God. Perhaps these ancient verses can aid our repentance in a world that often grieves our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Evil Within</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/05/14/Evil-Within"/>
 		<updated>2012-05-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/05/14/Evil-Within</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Erik Larson&amp;rsquo;s 2003 New York Times best seller &lt;em&gt;The Devil in the White City&lt;/em&gt; highlights the story of two men. The magical Chicago World’s Fair of 1893 involved architect Daniel Burnham who constructed what many called &amp;ldquo;The White City.&amp;rdquo; With the invention of electricity, he used floodlights to accentuate amazing architectural feats on Chicago&amp;rsquo;s southern shore of Lake Michigan. The book also highlights H.H. Holmes. His work was ambitious but extremely evil. He constructed a three block hotel in which he murdered (some believe) over 200 people. Leonardo Dicaprio has purchased the rights to the story and is in process of producing a movie (opening in 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The similarities and contrasts of these two men is fascinating. While both have grand schemes, Holmes&#39; sinister vision seems to have been bolstered by an unexplainable evil. Holmes targeted single young women in his diabolical plan. Screenwriter Graham Moore, in an interview with Deadline.com, describes Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holmes was a most likable guy who inwardly was a tremendous monster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we come to Genesis 3 this week, we find a similar character. A serpent approaches the first woman with a villainous proposal. It seems harmless on the surface; yet the impact of her (and eventually her husband&amp;rsquo;s) decision is immense. The story is familiar; we all know what happens. Yet as we enter into the story once again, we are reminded of our own failure, our own tendency for evil. While it is easy to blame Adam and Eve for the brokenness of our world, we have all participated in their actions. Join us on Sunday as we study Genesis 3 together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>The Gift of Women</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/05/07/gift-of-women"/>
 		<updated>2012-05-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/05/07/gift-of-women</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This coming Sunday is Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day. Celebrations for mothers date back to ancient civilizations and today vary among cultures and countries. In the United States, we designate the second Sunday in May to celebrate our moms. Restaurants appreciate the break we give our moms on this day. Kids sometimes do extra chores around the house our create a colorful card. On Sunday in worship, we will reflect on our shared mother, Eve. As we venture through the book of Genesis, it seems appropriate to consider the creation of woman in Genesis 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many are familiar with the story. Adam is placed in a coma while God removes one of his ribs. When he wakes up, he is presented with Eve. They join together in shameless sexuality and serve as models for marriage as God intended. What relevance does this text have for us in the year 2012? How might we approach Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day differently as we engage this text?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much discussion these days about gender. Gender inequality has curbed discussion of gender differences and roles. While male-dominated cultures have abused and neglected the gifts and contributions of women for thousands of years, a peek into God&amp;rsquo;s original plan may prove insightful. God created gender as a gift. If God intended us to ignore gender, the story would be different. As we explore Genesis 2, we find Adam in desperate need of a partner. He surveys all the animals to determine if one might be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 2:20 NIV) But for Adam no suitable helper was found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God responds by creating woman; she has all the necessary characteristics. She complements Adam in every way. They are able to fulfill God&amp;rsquo;s design to be fruitful and multiply. A key verse in the story is v. 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Genesis 2:25 NIV) The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam and Eve in Eden reveal God&amp;rsquo;s plan for gender and sexuality. Our differences in gender should be celebrated, not dismissed. One gender should not dominate the other; both are essential and invaluable. Together, we fulfill God&amp;rsquo;s design for His creation. Both Jesus and Paul point to Genesis 2 as they teach on marriage. This crucial text helps us understand the beauty and value of women. Join us on Sunday as we celebrate the gift of women.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Paradise</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/04/30/Paradise"/>
 		<updated>2012-04-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/04/30/Paradise</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We were certainly given a break this winter in Indiana; the weather was much milder than usual. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind a bit of cold weather. The changing of the seasons is beautiful. My wife would disagree. She grew up in South Georgia where it rarely gets below freezing. She wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind living in summer year round. Do you like tropical weather? Flowers blooming year round; no coats necessary. If you visit a climate like this, you might even refer to it as paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we are going to explore the first created environment for man and woman, Eden. What was this place like? Since they ran around naked or in fig leaves, the climate must have been warm. Was it paradise? That is an interesting word. In English, the word is not necessarily related to the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;paradise: a place or state of bliss, felicity, or delight (Webster Dictionary)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word in Greek (&lt;em&gt;paradeisos&lt;/em&gt;) includes the dynamic of bliss but refers more specifically to the surroundings. It literally means &amp;ldquo;an enclosed park&amp;rdquo;. It was often used to describe a garden. In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) the English-tranlated word &lt;em&gt;garden&lt;/em&gt; is rendered &lt;em&gt;paradeisos&lt;/em&gt;. No doubt, there is a connection with the original garden (Eden) and paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus is hanging on the cross, he says to the repentant criminal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 23:43) “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the connection between Eden and Jesus&#39; reference to paradise in Luke 23? Was Jesus referring to restored creation? Are those who place their faith in Jesus going to one day return to Eden? John describes the new heaven and the new earth in Revelation 22. The similarities with Eden are substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we compare our broken world to paradise, there is much to be desired. Eden seems more like a pipe dream than a reality. Yet throughout Scripture, we get hints of the restoration of Eden. While our world seems as far away from Eden as it ever has been, Jesus promises to restore, to make all things new. Join us on Sunday as we explore Eden; there is much to learn from initial dwelling of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Change 2</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/04/24/Change"/>
 		<updated>2012-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/04/24/Change</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have lived two Sundays in the new schedule. I know that it has been an adjustment for some of us. The praise band has to arrive early to sound check. Many who were accustomed to arriving for Sunday school at 10:15 now arrive at 9:15. Some Sunday school have been divided or discontinued as a result of the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is never easy. As we grow older, our bodies change (sometimes letting us down). Our kids grow up, move off to college. Friends relocate to different states. We sometimes have the difficult task of saying goodbye to friends and loved ones as they pass away. Yet we are required to change in life. As God leads us, we respond to his movement. Many times He calls us to adjust. And as we adapt, we experience transformation that would not be possible without change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we enter our first full month of our new Sunday morning schedule, allow me to remind you why and how we discerned the need for this change. Conversation began among leaders in November regarding the need for an adjustment of our Sunday morning schedule. We found that the Sunday school hour was inadequate as far as time for most classes. By the time people arrived for Sunday school, talked a bit and began the lesson, it was time to dismiss. Many classes found themselves with less than 30 minutes. Late worship service included less than half of its participants at the beginning of the service. Many were still in Sunday school and were unable to make it into the sanctuary on time. We&amp;rsquo;re not sure how we needed to change or even if we needed to change the schedule at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began an intentional Process of Discernment around the issue. This process included a time of exploration of options, a period of listening (which included outside information, people in the congregation, and prayerful consideration of the leading of the Spirit). We then examined the issue in light of our listening. There was an incredible unity among the leaders around the solution. Church leaders then brought the draft schedule to the congregation in January. Everyone was given an opportunity to ask questions, share opinions and discuss the ramifications of the change. Through a consensus vote, the congregation affirmed the discerning of the leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if you find the new schedule appealing. Maybe you think it is great; maybe you are having a hard time adjusting. In time, we will discover the benefits and liabilities of this change. For now, we trust that our careful discernment was not in vain. We trust that God has led us to this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we make decisions in the future, I hope that we will take the necessary time to discern the leading of the Spirit. Our decisions must not be based on personal preference (or what we perceive is best for &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo;). We must continue to ask God for His will, His desire for how we function. While any process is subject to human error, I have confidence that God will honor our discerning, that He will help us navigate the decisions that we must make as a congregation as we submit our will to His.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are concerns that you have regarding the new schedule, please take time to discuss the matter with church leaders. God may lead us to make further adjustments. Our discerning never ends; we continue with open ears as we participate in congregational life under the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s leading.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Rest</title>

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever attended a lock-in? If you were in a youth group, the answer is probably &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;. A lock-in usually involves staying up all night. I used to dread these events as a youth minister. I knew that the event would take its toll on me for the next week or so. It was fun staying up all night playing games, watching movies or playing hide-and-seek in the church. The bad part was the next day. I would usually go home and crash, sleeping 4 or 5 hours. I would wake up mid-afternoon and try to stay awake until bedtime. As I got older, these events were harder and harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that our bodies are not designed for this schedule. We are fashioned for 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Somehow our bodies reset during this time and allow us to be productive during the remaining 16 hours of the day. In the same way, we function best when we provide adequate time for relaxing and winding down. If you have worked more than 12 hours in a day, you know the feeling. You feel worn down and your creative energy takes a nose dive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are created by God to function in particular patterns. When we veer too far from this design, we suffer. We learn in the Creation story a distinct pattern for our weeks. God creates for six days and rests on the seventh. It is not that God wanted a break. God is all-powerful and does not need a repose to sustain energy. Yet he rests in order to model a pattern for us. God rests because he designed us to rest. We are in the image of God and function in the patterns of our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent decades our world has shifted dramatically away from understanding proper rest. Join us on Sunday as we discuss the seventh day of Creation. It has extreme relevance to our lives in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John Lasseter of Pixar Studios was being interviewed by Michelle Norris on National Public Radio. He was discussing the work of computer animation. Norris expressed her impression of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cars glisten &amp;hellip; It looks like we’re seeing photography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then questioned Lasseter,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything you can do with computer generated animation, are there still limitations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lassester affirmed the limitations, explaining the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more organic something is in the way it looks or the way it moves, the harder it is to create it with a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to explain that every frame of a movie takes about seventeen hours. According to the Los Angeles Times, production costs for Pixar films average about $140 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden announced a summer exhibit in which they took super close photos of tree bark. There was very little cost involved. The exhibit was described in these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One canvas is magenta red has curling squares of what looked like skin or material; another has furry brown hairs sprouting on green and orange stripes; and on a third, lip-like shapes float on a gray-white background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrasting of man-made verses organic/natural reminds us of what Dr. Lewis Foster observed many years ago. He relates,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closer one gets to something man has made, the more its imperfections are obvious. The more we magnify something God has created, the more we see its perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we begin a sermon series through the book of Genesis. We open our Bibles to Genesis 1, the story of Creation. The natural world is truly a work of art. Its complex and exquisite details are overwhelming; the vastness of the universe is overwhelming. But how did it all begin? We will walk through the first six days of Creation according to Genesis. As we engage the text, we discover our role as created beings made in God&amp;rsquo;s image.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am going to do something this Easter that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have ever done; I am going to be preaching from a psalm. I have preached from the Gospel accounts of the resurrection or even one of Paul&amp;rsquo;s epistles. It may seem strange to go to the Psalms at Easter. However when you look closer, it may make perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Jesus and the Apostles quoted Psalms more than any other Old Testament book? Did you realize that Jesus quoted from Psalms as he hung on the cross? Jesus certainly saw the connection of His ministry with the Psalms. While many psalms were written nearly a thousand years before Jesus, they have incredible relevance to His life, death, and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sunday we will consider selected verses from Psalm 118. While Psalm 22 and 31 (both quoted from the cross) describe the anguish, uncertainty and suffering of the cross, Psalm 118 reflects on the victory of God&amp;rsquo;s provision. On Easter we celebrate the most important truth in history, &amp;ldquo;He is Risen!&amp;rdquo; Yes God ventured to the depths on the cross, but His rising from the dead assures us that his death was not permanent. Look at how pertinent these words are to Easter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 118:15–17 NIV)  15) Shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous: “The LORD’s right hand has done mighty things! 16) The LORD’s right hand is lifted high; the LORD’s right hand has done mighty things!” 17) I will not die but live, and will proclaim what the LORD has done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David (the writer of Psalm 118) uses the same language used by Jesus and the Apostles to describe God&amp;rsquo;s plan in Christ. He talks about gates and capstones. The connection is astounding. Join us on Sunday as we explore Psalm 118 and celebrate the risen Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that we will meet for breakfast at 9:30 am and combined worship at 10:45 am.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>In Your Hands</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/03/26/In-Your-Hands"/>
 		<updated>2012-03-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/03/26/In-Your-Hands</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This Sunday is the last Sunday of Lent; we begin Holy Week. As we engage the Psalms on Sunday, we come to another text Jesus quoted on the Cross. As you might remember, we discussed Psalm 22 a few weeks ago; Jesus quoted this psalm as he hung on the cross. It is a psalm of desperation; God seems to have abandoned him. This week, we engage Psalm 31 together. The tone is a different from Psalm 22. While struggle is a primary theme, the psalm begins with a statement of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 31:1 NIV) In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in your righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The psalm is written by David; he is in a season of struggle. Yet his struggle is not one of desperation. He believes that God will deliver him. He says again in verse 4,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 31:4 NIV) Free me from the trap that is set for me, for you are my refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus quotes verse 5 just before he breathes his last breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 31:5 NIV) Into your hands I commit my spirit; redeem me, O LORD, the God of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a statement of trust, of confidence in the Father. It is difficult to imagine Jesus&#39; struggle. Some have attempted to recreate his suffering through the technology of Hollywood. Others have taken time to mediate on Passion through art. It is appropriate to turn to Jesus&amp;rsquo;s suffering during Holy Week. We will gather on Thursday, April 5 at 7:00 p.m. for reflection and communion. I hope you will make plans to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key point in this psalm is that David and Jesus&#39; suffering does not begin nor end in hopelessness. They exhibit a secure assurance that God will turn their struggle into redemption. Perhaps the pivot is verse 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 31:15 NIV) My times are in your hands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prayer is fitting for each of us. We are often challenged with uncertainty, strife and adversity. How will we respond? Will we curse God? Or will we place our lives in the hands of God? The psalms are not ancient books collecting dust. They are living words available for our circumstances. May we find peace and assurance in the words from Psalm 31. May we be challenged to trust, to depend on God in all we do and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Genesis Series</title>

 		<id>/blog/2012/03/25/Genesis-Series</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed time in the Psalms through the Lenten season. I have gained a new appreciation for this treasury of devotions. The psalms gift us with insight from ancient worshipers; they give us the human/divine encounter from the human side. So what is next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Easter, we will spend time in the book of Genesis. I wanted to give you a peek into where we are going in this study. We could easily spend several years in this book. It is a lengthy account of the beginning of the world through the period of the Patriarchs. However, we only plan to spend about 20-25 weeks in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis might be divided into two major sections. The ESV Study Bible suggests a two-part division: Primeval History (1:1–11:26)  and Patriarchal History (11:27–50:26). The first section begins with Creation and goes to the story of Abraham. The second part picks up with Abraham and covers the story of his family through Joseph. We will spend about nine weeks in the first part (finishing it up around Father&amp;rsquo;s Day); the second part should take us into the fall. We will not cover every verse; rather we will select passages attempting to maintain the flow of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to note that an intergenerational Sunday school class will be available during each Sunday school hour to engage the story on a deeper level. Here is a tentative plan for the first part of the study. I provide it for you in hopes that you will read ahead and prepare to engage the Scripture together in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4/15 In the Beginning (Genesis 1:1-25)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4/22 The 7th Day (Genesis 2:1–4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Randy Gruendyke from Taylor University will be with us on April 29&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5/6 Eden (Genesis 2:4–17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5/13 Creating Woman (Genesis 2:18–25) *Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5/20 The Fall (Genesis 3:1-24)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5/27 The Wickedness of Humanity (Genesis 6:1-8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6/3 Noah (Genesis 6-9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6/10 The Tower (Genesis 11:1-8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6/17 A Father&amp;rsquo;s Legacy (Genesis 11:10-32)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2012/03/20/schedule-change</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In just a few weeks, we will be transitioning to a new Sunday morning schedule. This is no small change for a congregation. However, we are excited about new opportunities as a result of this shift. I wanted to let you all know about a couple of changes regarding Sunday school. First of all, we are looking forward to increased time given to Sunday school in the new schedule. Classes should now have a full hour to fellowship, pray and study. The schedule looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:15 am - 10:15 am - Early Worship/Early Sunday School
10:15 am - 10:45 am - Fellowship time in the Lower Auditorium
10:45 am - 11:45 am - Late Worship/Late Sunday School&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Early Hour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Worship (traditional style) will take place in the sanctuary during the early hour. Youth and Children Sunday school will also meet during the early hour. Also, two intergenerational adult classes will meet during this time. These classes will function in two-month blocks. In other words, every two months the teachers and/or topics may shift. One of the classes will be primarily topic based. The teacher will deal with current issues relating them to Scripture. The second class will be Scripture based and will initially follow the sermon schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topical class will be taught by Doug Gregg through the end of June. This class will meet in the church lounge. They will be studying a book by Tony Campolo entitled &lt;em&gt;20 Hot Potatoes Christians are Afraid to Touch&lt;/em&gt;. The Scripture based class will be taught by Tim Stigers and Jim Butler and will meet in the lower auditorium. Since the sermons will be in Genesis following Easter, this class will also be in Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fellowship Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of the new schedule will be an increased opportunity for fellowship. In our current schedule, everyone is rushing around to make it to Sunday school on time. The new schedule will grant a full 30 minutes to spend time talking with people who possibly attend another service. I hope that everyone will take advantage of this occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Late Hour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late Worship (contemporary style) will take place in the sanctuary during the late hour. A chief problem with our current schedule was Sunday school classes running into the late hour. Many times late worship will begin with only half of the people in attendance during the opening song. The earlier start time will also allow students to make it back to campus for lunch. During this hour the Bykota, Two by Two and Friendship classes will meet along with a new intergenerational class. The intergenerational class will be a discussion based class that operates on two month blocks. In other words, every two months the teachers and/or topics may shift. The first block will begin April 15 and go through June. Bill Eidson, Susan Londt, Allen Shelton and others will rotate teaching this class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change sometimes brings fear. We aren&amp;rsquo;t always sure how everything will work out. I would encourage you to anticipate the positive in the new schedule. Let&amp;rsquo;s continue to explore, listen and be flexible as we make this transition as a church family. As Paul writes to the church at Philippi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus (Philippians 2:4–5 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to contact me or any church council member with questions about the new schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Repenting</title>

 		<updated>2012-03-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/03/19/Repenting</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We live in a world of excuses. Certainly inappropriate behavior often begins with abuse or inadequacies in care. Yet we sometimes fail to claim responsibility for our conduct. We have nearly erased the word &lt;em&gt;sin&lt;/em&gt; from our vocabularies. This week, we examine Psalm 51; David wrote this psalm following his indiscretion with Bathsheba. The language of the psalm informs our understanding of sin and repentance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David was a political leader; he was King. It is not uncommon for such leaders to engage in abuses of power, sexual escapades or corruption. Some may conclude that this is normal behavior; it just goes with the job. Yet David does not excuse his behavior. He takes full responsibility for his actions; he begs God to restore relationship with His broken servant. He admits his failure. We find the word sin used 7 times in just 19 verses. David openly admits his atrocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 51:3 NIV) For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we know that his offense affected many people, particularly Bathsheba, her husband and her child, David is most concerned with his failure to follow God&amp;rsquo;s leading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 51:4 NIV) Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have much to learn about true repentance. Our culture makes this concept challenging; it requires us to face our behavior head on. Join us on Sunday as we explore David&amp;rsquo;s response to God in Psalm 51.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Giving Thanks</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/03/13/Giving-Thanks"/>
 		<updated>2012-03-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/03/13/Giving-Thanks</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a place where you needed rescued? When we consider the word rescue, we often think of a child stuck in a well or Chilean miners trapped beneath the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. However, the word often applies to less newsworthy events in our lives. Perhaps an illness threatens your well being or life circumstances (like the loss of a job or a divorce) bulldoze your security. It is often in these places where we call out to God. We are desperate, needing God to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see this pattern over and over in the psalms. The psalmist calls out in distress; God responds. The psalmist is quick to give God credit. In this week&amp;rsquo;s psalm, we read,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 107:19 NIV) Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern is not only in the psalms; we see it throughout Scripture. In the Gospels, people come to Jesus with ailments; Jesus heals. Once the word is out that Jesus is able to perform such miracles, the crowds are unbearable. Everyone wants to be rescued when they are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happens after the rescue? How did the people respond once they were delivered from danger or disease? Some went about their way paying little attention to the severity of their trouble. Others are overwhelmed with hearts of gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Luke 17, Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem. He encounters ten men who were suffering from leprosy. This disease caused tremendous suffering, not only physically but socially as well. They would have been separated from their families and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 17:12–13 NIV) 12) They stood at a distance 13) and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt, they are in trouble; they are in desperate need of rescue. Luke tells us that Jesus heals them. But that is not Luke&amp;rsquo;s emphasis in the story. Luke describes what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 17:15–16 NIV) 15) One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. 16) He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him — and he was a Samaritan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there were ten guys in critical condition. Jesus gets them out and only one comes back to thank him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Luke 17:17–19 NIV) 17) Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? 18) Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” 19) Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This encounter illustrates our tendency to forget how bad things were once we are out of the woods. This ex-leper appropriately worships Jesus; he credits him for his astounding rescue. We all have various emancipations; some are more profound than others. Do we take the time to thank God when he delivers us? Do we continually live in a posture of gratitude. Join us on Sunday as we canvass Psalm 107. May we join the psalmist who repeats this phrase not once or twice but four times (v. 8, 15, 21, 31) in this psalm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 		<title>Creation Psalm</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/03/05/Creation-Psalm"/>
 		<updated>2012-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/03/05/Creation-Psalm</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been fun studying the Psalms for the past couple of weeks. It is amazing that we can join with God-followers that lived thousands of years ago in confessing God&amp;rsquo;s faithfulness to His people. This week, we come to Psalm 19. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be joined by the Taylor Sounds, a few singers from Taylor University including our own Audrey Boyers. The service will consist of Scripture reading, preaching, singing as we engage Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Psalm 19, David reflects on the majesty of God&amp;rsquo;s creation. While David did not understand all that modern science teaches us about nature, he marvels at the intricacies of our world. Our busy lives distract us from being astonished by the world around us. Yet David understands that the creation points us to the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we will explore the poetry of Psalm 19 together. We will sing, collectively read and reflect on these ancient words. I hope you are able to join us.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Reminded Psalms</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/02/27/Reminded-Psalms"/>
 		<updated>2012-02-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/02/27/Reminded-Psalms</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are you a forgetful person? I have to write everything down in order to remember. I actually have a list that I live by. If an item is not on my list, it does not exist. In our busy world, we need reminders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s Psalm, we are told that all nations will one day remember God&amp;rsquo;s works and turn to him. This is a fascinating psalm. The first verse of this psalm is familiar to all readers of the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 22:1 NIV) My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus chose to quote this psalm in his darkest hour. Twenty-six verses later, we are told that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 22:27 NIV) All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we talked about Sunday in worship, the psalms express every emotion possible. In Psalm 22, we experience the terror of God&amp;rsquo;s abandonment; we progress toward a confession that God&amp;rsquo;s actions will prompt the nations to remember and turn to God. This is often the story of our lives. We move from one emotion to the next. At times, we wonder if God has turned his back on us. Other times, we can boldly confess that God is with us. It is no coincidence that Jesus draws from this psalm on the worst and greatest day of human history. In the grip of Roman execution, God was saving the world. This paradox is the center of the gospel message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not that we forget the Cross; yet it does not always occupy a primary place in our minds. We need to be reminded. As we come to the table on Sunday, we will remember the work of Jesus on the Cross. Appropriately, we will study the psalm that he chose in the midst of his incredible work of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Trust Psalm 25</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/02/20/Trust-Psalm-25"/>
 		<updated>2012-02-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/02/20/Trust-Psalm-25</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am pleased with our recent mission series. It has created an opportunity to define our purpose, our vision and our continued efforts as a congregation. If you have not had a chance to catch up on the sermons from this series, they are all posted on the Web site on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fbcmuncie.org/why-we-exist/mission-series-videos/&quot;&gt;Mission Series Videos page&lt;/a&gt;. If you have not had a chance to see the artwork, be sure to take a stroll down the main hallway. We hope to have the artwork (as well as descriptions) posted on the Web site in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turn now to our next series. At the same time, we enter the season of Lent. Through the season of Lent, we will be exploring the Psalm reading provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/&quot;&gt;lectionary&lt;/a&gt; each week. This week we come to Psalm 25:1-10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psalm 25 challenges us to place our hope in God. While this may seem like an airy or clichéd saying, the demand of such a task can be daunting. Is God really trustworthy? What risks might I need to take to fully place my life in His hands? The psalmist begins,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 25:1 NIV) To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lifting up describes a great dependance on God. The psalmist is counting on God in a dramatic and passionate way; he places his very soul in God&amp;rsquo;s hands. However, he is certain that the risk is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trusting God, following His way often requires us to leave our own way behind. Are we willing to abandon cultural norms to follow God&amp;rsquo;s leading? Will we risk rejection from social circles to follow God&amp;rsquo;s way? Trusting in God is more than intellectual assent to God&amp;rsquo;s commands; it involves actively obeying his promptings. As we consider Psalm 25 this weekend, may God cement this truth in our souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psalms 25:10 NIV) All the ways of the LORD are loving and faithful for those who keep the demands of his covenant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 		<title>Discerning Schedule Change</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/02/15/Discerning-Schedule-Change"/>
 		<updated>2012-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/02/15/Discerning-Schedule-Change</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In November, we began a discernment process to determine if we should alter our Sunday morning schedule. The Leadership Council spent considerable time exploring options. We entered a three-week period of listening toward the end of November. We examined other church schedules, surveyed the congregation and spent time in prayer. We assembled together around the first of December to discern the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s movement among us. The Council developed a proposed plan that involved a concurrent schedule (9:15 Early Worship/Early Sunday School, 10:15 Fellowship Time, 10:45 Late Worship/Late Sunday School). On January 22 we met as a congregation to discuss this plan. This was an opportunity for feedback and ideas. At the end of this meeting we took a consensus vote to determine how everyone felt about this change. The results of the consensus vote were overwhelmingly supportive of the new schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we will initiate the &lt;strong&gt;schedule change on the Sunday following Easter (Sunday, April 15, 2012)&lt;/strong&gt;. On Easter we will meet in a combined worship gathering at the new late hour (10:45 a.m.). We will gather at 9:30 a.m. for an all church Easter Breakfast (No Sunday School on Easter). On Sunday, April 15, 2012, we will begin the new schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:15 Early Worship Gathering/Early Sunday School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:15 Fellowship Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:45 Late Worship Gathering/Late Sunday School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So what about Sunday School? When will the various classes meet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the plan. During the &lt;strong&gt;early Sunday school hour (9:15 a.m.)&lt;/strong&gt;, we will offer two intergenerational Sunday school classes. One class will be topical/issues based from a biblical perspective. The second class will be a Bible study working through various books of the Bible. Current teachers will be asked to teach for set periods of time, depending on their interest and schedule. These classes will provide a place for college students, retirees and all ages in between to sit together in study. Youth and Children&amp;rsquo;s Sunday school (including a nursery) will also take place during the early Sunday school hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;strong&gt;late Sunday school hour (10:45 a.m.)&lt;/strong&gt;, the Bykota, Two by Two and Friendship classes will meet. There will be a children&amp;rsquo;s church class for younger children, as well as a nursery during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may need to make further tweaks as we live in this schedule. We are excited about the new possibilities this schedule offers. A full hour for Sunday school, consistent start/end times for everyone, and a full half-hour fellowship time are a few of the advantages for this schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please continue to keep this change in your prayers. Change is never easy; this is substantial change for our congregation. However, we will find God&amp;rsquo;s provision as we follow his leading.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Beyond Us</title>

 		<id>/blog/2012/02/14/Beyond-Us</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have not been at church for past few weeks, you are going to be pleasantly surprised when you walk down the main hallway. We have been blessed by a Ball State student who has poured herself into five works over the past few weeks. Each piece has a unique story, yet they all form a unified expression of who we are as a church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we come to our final action word. All that we do, our gathering and caring and empowering and stewarding is to impact our community. Throughout Scripture, we find God&amp;rsquo;s story touching those on the outside. God&amp;rsquo;s people are never a closed group; God is interested in extending his work to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we explore Jesus&amp;rsquo;s words in Matthew 5. The Sermon on the Mount is a powerful, challenging message describing the Kingdom that Jesus initiates. His Kingdom values stand in opposition to the virtues of this world. To inhabit this way of life is no trivial task. Yet, as we do, our lives carry weight in this world. Our co-workers, family, friends recognize something different, something powerful in us. Jesus describes our influence as &lt;strong&gt;salt&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt;. These two images articulate the imprint of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are the salt of the earth &amp;hellip; You are the light of the world (Matthew 5:13-14)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we explore Jesus&amp;rsquo;s intention in using these images. What do they mean for us in 2012? How might all that do impact our community?&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Offering Ourselves</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/02/06/offering-ourselves"/>

 		<id>/blog/2012/02/06/offering-ourselves</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To say that the Holy Spirit is involved in our worship planning is a no brainer. We would all agree that somehow God acts and moves in my sermon preparation and delivery, in Matt&amp;rsquo;s selection of liturgy, in all aspects of our work. Why then are we surprised when something we read, a situation we experience, or a conversation ties directly to our topic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Common-Prayer-Ordinary-Radicals-ebook/dp/B003V4B574/ref=kinw_dp_ke?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&quot;&gt;Common Prayer: A Liturgy for Ordinary Radicals&lt;/a&gt; this morning and came across a quote from Jesuit Jean-Pierre de Caussade (18th Century). Now, don&amp;rsquo;t forget, this upcoming sermon is on stewardship; it is about realizing all we have is God&amp;rsquo;s and we are responsible to use it for his purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great and firm foundation of the spiritual life is the offering of ourselves to God and being subject to his will in all things. We must completely forget ourselves, so that we regard ourselves as an object which has been sold and over which we no longer have any rights. We find all our joy in fulfilling God’s pleasure — his happiness, his glory and the fact that he is our great and only delight. Once we have this foundation, all we need to do is spend our lives rejoicing that God is God and being so wholly abandoned to his will that we are quite indifferent as to what we do and equally indifferent as to what use he makes of our activities. (p. 134)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may need to read this a couple of times to let it sink in. It is a powerful confession that our lives are not our own. We have given them over to God to use for his purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see the word &amp;ldquo;steward&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;stewardship&amp;rdquo; in a sermon title, we assume the pastor is going to talk about money. But stewardship is much deeper than dollars. Sure, it has to do with dollars. If our checkbooks are not submitted to God, there is a problem. Jesus has much to say about money and it a key concern for anyone who seriously follows Him. Yet, living as a steward is a worldview; it is about how we understand our proper relationship to the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to explore the parable of the prudent steward in Luke 16:1-13 this week. Jesus defines our position before God as He shocks us by praising questionable behavior. Join us on Sunday as we engage the story together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Empowering</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/01/30/Empowering"/>
 		<updated>2012-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/01/30/Empowering</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed the first two weeks of our mission statement series. It has been fun to explore the fundamental reasons that we exist. As we prepare for our third week in this series, we consider the third action word, &amp;ldquo;empower.&amp;rdquo; If you look up this word in the dictionary you will find that it is defined,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;to give somebody a greater sense of confidence or self-esteem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this what we mean when we speak of the need to empower one another in the church? Are we simply trying to bolster individual confidence in matters of faith? I am not sure that this definition offers an accurate picture of what was intended  in our mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort of empowering that we are talking about has to do with equipping believers to walk with Christ. A better definition might include the words &amp;ldquo;equipping, preparing, or training.&amp;rdquo; You might even consider using the word &amp;ldquo;disciple.&amp;rdquo; As Jesus ascended into heaven he commanded believers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we are talking about empowering, we are talking about discipleship. But what does this look like? How does it play out in the life of the church? On Sunday, we will consider how we empower one another to be all that God wants us to be. It is more than what we have often termed &amp;ldquo;Christian education.&amp;rdquo; It is more than learning and passing on a curriculum. It is about sharing life together. Join us on Sunday as we explore the third action verb of our mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Sick Day</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2012/01/23/Sick-Day"/>
 		<updated>2012-01-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2012/01/23/Sick-Day</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past weekend was a difficult weekend for me. I sat at home with a stomach virus while you all gathered for worship on Sunday. To make matters worse, you also gathered to reflect on an important church decision about changing our Sunday morning schedule; I was unable to join you. This was the first Sunday that I can remember missing church because of sickness. It was not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it was coincidence that the virus hit on Saturday afternoon. As I fought through the symptoms, you all stepped up in a variety of ways. Matt delivered the planned sermon articulately and authentically. The church leaders (the Leadership Council) communicated their discerning over the past few months regarding our Sunday morning schedule. It was fulfilling to see my efforts made complete through your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is always a stretch to compare our own experience to the experience of Jesus, I find a correlation to Jesus leaving the Kingdom work in the hands of his followers. Jesus knew that his work would culminate with his death and resurrection; he knew he would be leaving his friends. Jesus prayed for those he would leave behind; he also prayed for all who would hear His message in years to come; this includes you and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(John 17:20 NIV) My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus then describes how all of this would work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(John 17:23 NIV) I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus&#39; work extends to you and me. John tells us that Jesus is &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; us. In his first letter, John describes how Jesus&#39; love for us is made complete; we will talk more about this on Sunday. God&amp;rsquo;s love is complete as we love one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 John 4:12 NIV) No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus is not physically with us; yet as we love one another, we complete the work of the Kingdom. He works &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; us to &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; His work. As we consider the second action verb of our mission statement, we understand that our caring for one another is rooted in Jesus&#39; love for us. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there; as we care for (love) one another, we are completing the work of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying to know that First Baptist Church Muncie does not depend on my presence. God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit in you is what makes First Baptist Church Muncie. As each of us follows the leading of the Spirit, he does his work in us. I am looking forward to being with you this weekend; it is no fun missing out. Yet, I am thankful that God has equipped you with all you need when I am not with you.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We just returned from a great weekend in Wisconsin with the teenagers; it was a great time to connect with them. The speaker talked about apologetics (defending our faith). Teens are often faced with friends who do not believe in God. The speaker gave our teens tools for conversation with their friends on such issues. Thanks to Doug Gregg for preaching on Sunday in my absence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we gather for worship this Sunday, we begin a five-week series on our mission as a church. We will talk about the importance of gathering. As we find ourselves frequently communicating digitally, we find ourselves in less physical conversation. Sure, there are many advantages to social networks and digital communication. However, I wonder if we are missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might remember, our mission statement is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Spirit-led people gathered to care for and empower each other by stewarding God&amp;rsquo;s resources to impact our community for Christ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a people, led by the Holy Spirit. But we are not just led by the Holy Spirit; we are gathered. Our gathering takes shape in at least three ways. We will explore these ways on Sunday. I will not spoil it for you now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I would like to leave you with the words of the author of Hebrews. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget, early Christians risked much in order to gather. In many places, it was forbidden for them to gather. Yet the author of Hebrews encourages Christians to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Hebrews 10:24–25 NIV) And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another — and all the more as you see the Day approaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday as we explore the critical necessity of coming together.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<id>/blog/2012/01/01/Responding-to-the-King</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am sitting in South Georgia on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day reviewing next week&amp;rsquo;s sermon. New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day is almost over; many will return to normal routines in the next few days. In most minds Christmas is over. Yet, we are only midway through the season of Christmas. Did you know that the Christmas season (on the Christian calendar) does not end until January 6. Perhaps you have heard of the twelve days of Christmas. January 6 is Epiphany, the celebration of the Magi&amp;rsquo;s visit to young Jesus. I will not spoil the sermon for Sunday by giving you details of this visit. The story centers on a group of king&amp;rsquo;s representatives seeking the newly arrived King in Bethlehem. They first go to Herod, the region&amp;rsquo;s political king. They figure he must know of the birth. When Herod hears of the possibility of another king, he freaks out. He slays all toddlers in the city. His response to the birth of Jesus reveals selfish ambition; his act causes much heartache for the mother&amp;rsquo;s of Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is of one of kings and their response to Jesus. The Kings or representatives of Kings (the wise men) travel great lengths, giving of themselves. The King of Judea (Herod) goes to great lengths to protect himself (his right to rule). Do we find ourselves more like the wise men or Herod? Do we bring gifts, giving of ourself for Jesus. As we care for those who are oppressed, downtrodden, those in need, we care for Jesus. Matthew relays Jesus&#39; words,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 25:45 NIV) I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or do we cling to control like Herod, destroying innocent bystanders in the process? Can you imagine God in our midst? There he was in a house with Mary and Joseph. May we find ourselves as the Magi, submitting ourselves to Him, bringing gifts to the true King.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we explore Epiphany on Sunday (or as you celebrate it this week on January 6), may our hearts and minds be enlightened by this story. May we be challenged to worship as the Magi. May we bring appropriate gifts to the King. May our own agendas be put to death for His agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish you all a happy new year today and pray that 2012 would be year of spiritual blessing for you. We pray that your hearts will be drawn to the Savior who gave Himself for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 Corinthians 16:23–24 NIV) The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 		<title>Christmas Worship</title>

 		<id>/blog/2011/12/19/Christmas-Worship</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With Christmas less than one week away, we are preparing for two special worship services this weekend. We will meet on Christmas Eve at 7:00 p.m. to celebrate the coming of Jesus in a candlelight atmosphere. We will consider Isaiah 9. We celebrate the fact that God broke into darkness; He came as light into the world to redeem us. This shattering of darkness took the form of a child, a son. As we gather on Christmas Eve, we celebrate this child as the one who fulfills the words of Isaiah, the promises of God from ages past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Christmas morning, we will consider the Christmas story as recorded in Luke 2. Jesus&#39; birth was not a snow filled, hot chocolate laced occasion. It was messy, dirty, smelly; we will remind ourselves of the story that we have heard a million times. As we celebrate Christmas, we will remember that Christmas was a pretty scary occasion for those in Luke 2. Yet the angel’s words, “do not be afraid” assure us that God was and is up to something incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that holidays can be busy. Many are traveling, others are spending concentrated time with family. Yet, I encourage you to carve out time to worship. Join us as we remember the true meaning of Christmas this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you traveling out of town, we wish you a merry and Jesus-centered Christmas. For everyone else, I will see you this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It may seem strange to get a newsletter for January before Christmas. However, with vacation schedules, it seemed appropriate to go ahead and mail out a short newsletter for January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to let you know about an upcoming sermon series that will begin on January 22. We will be spending five weeks talking about our mission as a church. You may remember talking about this in August; we affirmed a new mission statement at this time. However, we have not spent much time digging deep into this statement. I hope that through this sermon series you will develop a distinctive understanding of who we are and who we are called to be as a church. This past fall, a Ball State student developed artwork around the statement; we will unveil one piece at a time over these five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read through the mission statement documentation at &lt;a href=&quot;http://fbcmuncie.org/why-we-exist/&quot;&gt;http://fbcmuncie.org/why-we-exist/&lt;/a&gt; . I would encourage you to take a few minutes and read through this description of our mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Spirit-led people &lt;strong&gt;gathered&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;care&lt;/strong&gt; for and &lt;strong&gt;empower&lt;/strong&gt; each other by &lt;strong&gt;stewarding&lt;/strong&gt; God&amp;rsquo;s resources to &lt;strong&gt;impact&lt;/strong&gt; our community for Christ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you all have a Merry Christmas and a happy new year. I look forward to serving with you in Christ’s mission in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a schedule for the series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 22 – Gather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 29 – Care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February 5 – Empower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February 12 – Steward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February 19 - Impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 		<title>Faithful God</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2011/12/12/Faithful-God"/>

 		<id>/blog/2011/12/12/Faithful-God</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, we gather in one combined service to celebrate the coming of Christmas through music. However, we will also open God&amp;rsquo;s Word together to Isaiah 61. Following up from last week&amp;rsquo;s text, the prophet speaks of the coming Messiah as one who will seal the covenant of God with His people. This covenant is rooted in the character of God and provides a permanence that is beyond our performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world that operates in a get-what-you-deserve mindset, the idea that God&amp;rsquo;s love for us reaches beyond our accomplishments is baffling. Yet, this is what we find in the text. As we prepare to engage this text, allow me to point to a key phrase. Notice the prepositional phrase in verse 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Isaiah 61:8 NIV) In my faithfulness I will reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is making a covenant because he is faithful; it is not because we have displayed merit. Does God have to act? If he cuts us off, is he breaking a previous promise? In chapter 54, Isaiah describes the fuel for the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Isaiah 54:10 NIV) Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed,” says the LORD, who has compassion on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What feeds God&amp;rsquo;s covenant? It is His love for us. This love is unfailing, certain, absolute. It does not come and go. Isaiah continues by describing this covenant as a marriage. While we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily equate marriage with permanence in our culture, marriage is intended to be a lasting promise. It should not be subject to whims or passing trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s promise to His people will come to fruition in Jesus. Jesus reveals an intense love, one that is willing to sacrifice Himself. He leaves the security of heaven and enters a dangerous world. As we ramp up toward Christmas, may the anticipation of God&amp;rsquo;s fulfilled promise create indescribable joy. May we experience the burning love of a faithful God.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Fulfilling the Prophets</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2011/12/05/Fulfilling-the-Prophets"/>
 		<updated>2011-12-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2011/12/05/Fulfilling-the-Prophets</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have been talking about the prophet’s predictions of Jesus’ coming this Advent season. Jesus told us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 5:17 NIV) “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writings of the prophet Isaiah point hundreds of years into the future to describe the coming of the Messiah. However, Isaiah describes the Messiah in a different way from how most thought he would come. Throughout the Old Testament, it was understood that the Messiah would be from the line of David. Many assumed that he would come in political power. But in Isaiah 61 we find a very different description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you might want to note that when Jesus comes to his hometown, following the beginning of his ministry, he teaches in the synagogue. He picks up the scroll and reads from Isaiah 61. He describes himself as fulfilling this Scripture. So what does Isaiah tell us about the Messiah? How is this description different from how most people thought he would come?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me warn you, this is a loaded text. We could spend six weeks on these first four verses. At the same time, they are worth considering together as we contemplate the coming of Christ this Advent season. Isaiah uses seven purpose statements to describe the Messiah. On Sunday, we will delve into each of these to aid our understanding of what Jesus has come to do. Let me challenge you to read Isaiah 61:1-4 as you prepare for worship this week.&lt;/p&gt;

 		<title>Anticipation</title>
 		<link href="/blog/2011/11/28/Anticipation"/>
 		<updated>2011-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
 		<id>/blog/2011/11/28/Anticipation</id>
 		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past Sunday, we entered into the season of Advent. You have to admit, our church building glows during this season; it is perhaps at its finest with Christmas decorations. The building is a visual reminder of a deeper truth; Christmas is a season abuzz with anticipation. We often anticipate the sentimental traditions of the season; yet a greater level of anticipation is possible in this season. Jesus is coming! I know he came two thousand years ago, but he is coming again. Expectancy is an appropriate posture in this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prophet Isaiah spoke in expectant tones hundreds of years before Jesus came. The people of his day were far from God. In fact, they were not far from going into exile because of their sin. Being carted off by foreign armies might make you question God&amp;rsquo;s presence; you might feel abandoned. But God speaks through Isaiah offering a promise that he will not leave His people. Yes, the people will experience trying times as they are ripped from their homeland. But God will fulfill his promise; when it seems He has given up, he will come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Isaiah 40, the prophet speaks words of comfort, of consolation. He reminds the people that His coming will be a highway. When Jesus shows up, the curvy, hard to travel roads will burst into interstates. God is going to blast through mountains; he is going four-lane. When we open the gospels, we find the writers quoting Isaiah 40. They understood Jesus as fulfilling the prophet&amp;rsquo;s words. As we anticipate the celebration of Jesus&#39; birth, may we live in the tension of Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s words. They needed God to show up; He promised He would come. We need God to show up; may we long for his movement in our world today.&lt;/p&gt;
