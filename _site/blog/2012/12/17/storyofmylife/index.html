<p>I’ve noticed a trend. After recently donning some new leadership and
life roles, many good-natured folks have inquired about what I’ve done
with my life lately (besides create the illusion of a perpetual chaotic
furor). What you’re reading is one attempt towards bucking this trend.</p>

<p>I believe good leaders tell stories. While I don’t have the strongest
track record for consistent updates on
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/MatthewPaulHeadley">Facebook</a> or
<a href="https://twitter.com/mattheadley">Twitter</a>, I’m planning to regularly
carve out time to tell stories here of what God is up to in my life and
ministry. Here goes.</p>

<p>Four big things began in my life between July and October of 2012.</p>

<ul>
<li>July: Youth Ministry. I was called to join the staff a parachurch
organization called Muncie Area Youth for Christ
<a href="http://www.yfc.net/">(YFC)</a> as the coordinator for a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MuncieCentralCampusLife">“Campus
Life”</a> ministry in
the Muncie Central High School community.</li>
<li>August: Church Leadership. After three years of serving <a href="http://fbcmuncie.org">First
Baptist Church of Muncie</a> as a worship arts
director, I was called to serve as an associate pastor, broadening
my previous leadership role to include outreach ministry.</li>
<li>September: Parenthood. My wife and I met Hannah Joy, an amazing new person who is also our first child. Three words: Beautiful. Scary.
Hilarious.</li>
<li>October: Education. For the grand finale of my journey through an
M.Div. with <a href="http://www.seminary.edu/">Northern Seminary</a>, I began a
chaplaincy internship with the gifted staff in the spiritual care
department at Ball Memorial Hospital.</li>
</ul>


<p>These new commitments have presented me with some exciting and
formidable challenges. I’ve been humbled by the patience and grace
friends around me have extended as I work to balance these commitments
out. I hope that, as I tell my story and how God is working through it,
you will see him moving in your own life, in our community, and maybe
even the world. Peace!</p>
