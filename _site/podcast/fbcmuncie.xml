        <title>The Body of Christ</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Paul uses the illustration of anatomy to describe the way we function as a church. A physical body has many parts, but it is one unit. Each part has a vital role in is health. As we study 1 Corinthians 12:12-31a, we are each challenged to steward our time and energy in ways that strengthen the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Giving God Credit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Psalm 29, David challenges us to give God credit in all things. But giving credit to God is more than lip service. It includes giving God what he is due. This plays out in the way in which we allocate our resources (our time, our money, our attention). And the promise of this psalm is that when we truly make God King (ascribe to Him all that is due Him), he blesses his people with peace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Posture of Sacrifice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On this first Sunday of Epiphany, we consider the journey of the wise men. They travel a great distance and offer valuable gifts in order to worship Jesus. Their worship is a model of authentic worship. May we consider our own acts of worship as we engage the story together. Matthew 2:1-12&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Christmas Eve</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The candlelight Christmas Eve service at First Baptist Church Muncie is a highlight of the Christmas season. Families gather to kick off Christmas celebrations in a beautifully decorated sanctuary. As we light Christmas eve candle, we remember the reason for our celebration. The story of Christmas is placed in the context of Christ&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice for us. There is no more appropriate way to begin Christmas than by receiving the most precious gift, His body broken for us and His blood shed for us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mary's Song</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we approach Christmas day, we are often overwhelmed with the stress of the holiday season. The hustle and bustle of buying gifts and preparing food often overshadow the true meaning of Christmas. On this third Sunday of Advent, we consider Mary&amp;rsquo;s response to God&amp;rsquo;s intervention in her life. It is a response of giving. May we be challenged through this story to submit our lives to God&amp;rsquo;s purposes. Luke 1:39-55&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Re Focus</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our lives are often overwhelmed by the anxiety of our current circumstances. In this Advent season, we are challenged to refocus on the greater realities. As Paul instructed the Philippians church, we must place our anxieties in God’s care. As we are able to do this, we will experience a piece that is beyond understanding. Philippians 4:4-7&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Expectant</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt; Paul&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Philippians allows us to peer into his heart. He is confident that God will complete the work He began in the Philippians church. He anticipates that this work one day come to an end as Jesus returns. His prayer for the Philippians is that they would also live in this anticipation of Jesus&amp;rsquo;s return. As you and I explore this text, we are challenged to live in a posture of expectancy and urgency. God will one day return; this truth should drive us as we live out the gospel in our world. Philippians 1:3-11&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>His Return</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we approach the season of Advent, we are reminded that it is a season of urgency and expectancy. Jesus called his disciples to this posture of urgency and expectancy as he told them of his second coming. May we learn to live in the same posture as we look forward to Christ&amp;rsquo;s return.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Story of Jonah</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 18, we will worship in a combined worship service at 1045 a.m. The children will share a musical about the story of Jonah. We will also reflect the sermon on the call of God in our own lives. Jonah was more concerned about his own comfort, less concerned about following God’s mission in the world. We are challenged by his story to discard our own plans for God’s mission.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Closing Scene</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the closing scenes of Genesis, we are reminded that God’s story is not over. As Jacob and Joseph pass from the scene, the promise of deliverance looms. As the curtain closes in Genesis, Joseph is embalmed and lies in an Egyptian coffin. Yet the story of God continues. As we gather, we are reminded of our connection with this story. We are reminded that God’s grace comes to fruition through the work of Jesus. As we connect and live in story of God, we are transformed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Destiny of Jacob's Sons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 49, Jacob calls his sons to his deathbed for a blessing. He speaks powerful words that shape generations to come. His sons, forming the twelve tribes of Israel, will prepare the way for God to enter the world through Jesus. As the book of Genesis nears its end, we are reminded that the story continues as the people of God are now formed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Surprise Blessing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we near the conclusion of the book of Genesis, Jacob is near death. Joseph and his sons pay a visit to his ailing father. Jacob’s actions of adopting and blessing his grandsons remind us that God often moves in surprising ways. As we learn to follow God, we discover that He often acts and moves in ways that we would not plan. Genesis 48&lt;/p&gt;
