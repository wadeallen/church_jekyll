<blockquote>I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. (Romans 12:1â€“2)</blockquote>

<p>While joining us on Sunday will be the most effective way to to learn what our worship gatherings are like, a brief description may be helpful. 
</p>

<p>Our early gathering at 9:15am is more traditional in style with congregational hymns, a choir and an organ. The late gathering at 11:15am usually follows a format similar to the early service, yet is more contemporary in style with music usually lead by our band.  Everyone is encouraged to participate in either of our gatherings.
