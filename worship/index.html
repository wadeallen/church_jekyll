<blockquote>
  <p>I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. (Romans 12:1â€“2)</p>

<p>While joining us on Sunday morning will be the most effective way to to learn what our worship gatherings are like, here&#8217;s a brief description.</p>

		             <h3>9:15 Gathering</h3>
		             <p>Our early gathering is stylistically &#8220;traditional,&#8221; with hymn singing led by a choir and an organ.</p>
		           </li>
		           <li class="four columns">
		             <h3>10:45 Gathering</h3>
		             <p>The late gathering follows a similar format, yet is more &#8220;contemporary&#8221; in musical style.  Everyone is encouraged to join and participate in either of our gatherings.</p>
		           </li>
		         </ul>

<p>Both gatherings are planned collaboratively by creative leaders among us. In our gatherings we aim to utilize ancient practices of the Church with a modern, contextual approach.  Our liturgy (i.e., service of the people, or what we do when we gather) includes Scripture readings, preaching, singing, prayer, visual art &amp; media, storytelling, giving (tithes &amp; financial offerings), the Eucharist (Lord&#8217;s Supper/communion), baptisms, and ancient and modern professions of faith.</p>

<p>Music is an important part of our Sunday worship gatherings.  Musical ensembles that lead our church in worship include a contemporary band, choirs, handbell ringers, and various instrumental groups.  If you are interested in participating in leading the music for our gathering, please submit this form [can we keep the wufoo form below?] and Matt will contact you.</p>

<p>Our music rehearsal schedules will be changing in 2013, but if you want to see what&#8217;s happening now, please check the <a href="/calendar">church calendar</a> for a weekly schedule.</p>
