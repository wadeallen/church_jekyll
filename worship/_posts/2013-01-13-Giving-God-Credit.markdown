In Psalm 29, David challenges us to give God credit in all things. But giving credit to God is more than lip service. It includes giving God what he is due. This plays out in the way in which we allocate our resources (our time, our money, our attention). And the promise of this psalm is that when we truly make God King (ascribe to Him all that is due Him), he blesses his people with peace.
