On **Sunday, May 19**, we will celebrate, as a congregation, our pastor. In June 2012, Wade graduated from Northern Seminary with the Doctor of Ministry degree. In September 2013, Wade will celebrate his 20th anniversary of ordination. On this special Sunday, we will have a combined worship service at 10:45 AM followed by a celebration lunch. Alistair Brown, President of Northern Seminary, will be preaching in worship. Plan to join us on this special occasion.
