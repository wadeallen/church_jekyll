Paul prays for the Ephesian church (and other churches throughout Asia minor). He prays, through the power of the Holy Spirit, that the church would know God. He prays that they would be able to experience the power that comes through following God. Paul longs for the church to experience the beautiful connectedness of the church to Christ, knowing and living in Him. Ephesians 1:15-23
