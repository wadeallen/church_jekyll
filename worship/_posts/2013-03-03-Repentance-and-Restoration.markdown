As Jesus encounters tragedy, he corrects the common understandings of his day. While the religious pious point fingers at the sins of others, Jesus directs them toward examining their own hearts. He warns them of coming destruction if they fail to repent. As we engage this text, we are challenged to abandon fruitless religion for intimate relationship with God. Luke 13:1-9
