Paul's letter to the Philippians allows us to peer into his heart. He is confident that God will complete the work He began in the Philippians church. He anticipates that this work one day come to an end as Jesus returns. His prayer for the Philippians is that they would also live in this anticipation of Jesus's return. As you and I explore this text, we are challenged to live in a posture of expectancy and urgency. God will one day return; this truth should drive us as we live out the gospel in our world.
