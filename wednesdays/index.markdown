During the school year, there are a variety of programs on Wednesday evenings. We usually gather for a shared meal at 5:30 PM and then a variety of options are available. A typical Wednesday evening looks like this:

**4:30 p.m.** Prayer Shawl Meeting, **5:30 p.m.** Evening Meal, **6:00 p.m.** Childrenâ€™s Program, **6:15 p.m.** Band Rehearsal, **6:30 p.m.** Bible Study

Rehearsals schedules vary according to the week.

Be sure to check out the [church calendar](/calendar) for more concrete times and dates.
