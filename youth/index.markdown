title: Youth Ministry
---

First Baptist Church Muncie is a church family working together to bring God's Kingdom to Earth!
The youth ministry at First Baptist takes a family based approach. The youth ministry is committed to the reality that young people are an important and integral part of our church community. The youth program seeks to foster the maturing of faith in the youth of our church. The first principle of family-based youth ministry is this primary goal: to equip young people to grow toward mature Christian adulthood (that is, to present them “perfect” or “complete” in Christ). Colossians 1:28-29 expresses the goal of family-based youth ministry:

>"Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.29 To this end I also labor, striving according to His working which works in me mightily."

By focusing on equipping parents and the extended Christian family, churches can maintain an open and flexible stance toward the changes that will be demanded of youth ministry in the 21st Century. (Family-Based Youth Ministry by Mark DeVries) This ministry requires the participation of the entire Church. The focus for Christian adults is to encourage and mentor the youth of our community by example in service and spirituality. Furthermore, it is their responsibility to invite the youth to work and pray alongside them. This ministry is designed to encourage our youth in learning about all aspects of service and ministry. The youth have the opportunity not only to grow in their faith, but to have fun at the same time.

##Mission Statement for Youth Ministry

In partnership with families, the youth ministry of FBC exists to engage 100% of the students under its care, to train them to live independently in Christ, and to send them out as exceptional, godly men and women of integrity who will transform their homes, their schools, their churches, their workplaces, and their worlds for Christ.

The youth ministry is:

###Church Connected

Youth ministry is a vital part of the overall church ministry. Our goal is to provide a supportive Christ-centered environment where youths may develop holistically — intellectually, emotionally, spiritually, physically, and socially (Luke 2:52), — so that they may know Christ as their Lord and Savior. It is our desire to see them become true disciples of Christ (Matt 28:19, 20), so that they may serve and love God wholeheartedly (Luke 10:27). All youth programs and activities are designed with this goal in mind.

###Relationship Based

Youth ministry implements the tasks of modeling, counseling, teaching, praying, supporting, mentoring, training, discipling and bridging. The message communicated to youths is not only by word or by action, but by providing a living example of Christian faith and realistic problem-solving. All youth workers strive to gain the trust and respect of the youths as a foundation for personal friendship and mentoring.

###Parent Inclusive

This youth ministry desires to integrate youths into the life of the church body, to prepare them to become leaders now and tomorrow in the church, and to equip the young saints for the work of service (Eph 4:12,13). This youth ministry takes a team approach, and values the active support and involvement of parents and other adults in caring for the youths. Our goal is to lead teens to live a life pleasing to God and guide them to grow into spiritually mature and Godly adults. The youth ministry of FBC assists parents by partnering with them in their God-given role of teaching and training their children to (1) know God, (2) cultivate Christ-likeness, (3) apply scriptural truth to daily life, and (4) serve God and others.

###Age Diverse

What we should do is to continue to provide a place for youth to be around other people their age, and around older mature adults, as well as children who are younger than them. What we need to remember is that the youth minister and youth programs are not substitutes for the commitment that parents make to nurture their children into mature adulthood.

###Programed Practically

Through a variety of programs, events and outreach, we seek to draw young people into responsible participation in the life, work and mission of the church community. Sunday Mornings: Corporate Worship, Youth Sunday School Sunday Evenings: Youth Group Meetings and Programming and Service
