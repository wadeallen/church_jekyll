Our church is always looking for ways to serve you as you live out your faith throughout the week. We are inviting you to have a free account to an exciting new video library called RightNow Media. It's essentially the "Netflix of Video Bible Studies" because you will have instant access to thousands of great videos for kids, youth, parents, married couples and more. 

There are over 2,000 videos from some great teachers. If not already, you will soon be receiving an official "invitation email" to give you FREE access to this library. If you haven't received it already can you check your mail filter and accept the invite today? Because it was coming from RightNow's system, it may have got caught there. 

Simply find the email, click on the link, put in your name and a password and you're all set. All of the videos are FREE for everyone to use. 

You have the ability to view these videos on your computer, phone, tablet, or even on your television! You can also view them in a group setting using a projector. There is a simple way to "cast" the video to a TV at your home or even at church for Sunday School or another group meeting. Check out the vast array of videos and begin learning right now!
