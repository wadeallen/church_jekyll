description:
  As we near the conclusion of the book of Genesis, Jacob is near death. Joseph and his sons pay a visit to his ailing father. Jacobâ€™s actions of adopting and blessing his grandsons remind us that God often moves in surprising ways. As we learn to follow God, we discover that He often acts and moves in ways that we would not plan. Genesis 48
