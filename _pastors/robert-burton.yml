bio:
  Robert is the Minister to Senior Adults. He has served First Baptist since 2008. He and his wife Lydia have been members of First Baptist since 1999.

  Robert Burton, retired after forty one years in ministry, thirty two of which was as a hospital chaplain, is Minister for Pastoral Care for First Baptist and Pastor of our sister church, Riverside Avenue Baptist Church. A graduate of Carson-Newman College (B.A.) and Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary (B.D., Th.M., and D.Min.), he is a Board Certified Chaplain (Retired), AAMFT Clinical Member, and a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist.
  
  He and his wife, Lydia, sing in the choir at First Baptist. She is a registered nurse. They have three grown daughters, Grace, Mary Jane, and Nannette and six grandchildren, Jacob, Will, Helen, Audrey, and John. His hobbies include collecting books about cars (which is cheaper than collecting cars themselves) and being a rather serious audiophile with an assortment of vintage vacuum tube amplifiers.
