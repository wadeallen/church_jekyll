bio:
  I’ve been serving in leadership with First Baptist Church since July 2009. My wife Heather and I got married and moved from Alabama to Muncie that same summer. Heather is a grad student in piano at Ball State and teaches private piano lessons. After three years of serving as a worship arts pastor here and commuting to Chicagoland for seminary, I’ll be finishing up my M.Div. from Northern Seminary in Lombard, Illinois with a chaplaincy internship at Ball Memorial Hospital.  I was called to serve our church an associate pastor in August 2012. We had our first baby, Hannah Joy, in September 2012, and are finally enjoying planting some deeper roots in this community.  I also lead a Campus Life ministry at Muncie Central High School under the parent organization Muncie Area Youth for Christ. In my new post-seminary life I’m looking forward to doing fun things with Muncie friends like camping, running, making music, watching movies, and playing with gadgets.
