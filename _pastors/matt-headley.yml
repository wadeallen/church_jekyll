bio: Hey, I’m Matt.  I’ve been a pastor of First Baptist Church of Muncie since July 2009 and a Muncie Central High School ministry director with Muncie Area Youth for Christ since July 2012. My lovely wife Heather and I moved here from Alabama right after we got hitched in 2009.  Our daughter, Hannah Joy, was born last year and we are expecting our second child this fall!  I completed an M.Div. through Northern Seminary in Lombard, Illinois in July of 2013. We enjoy participating in the Muncie community and have a special interest in urban Muncie.  I’m always looking for excuses to do anything outdoors (running, cycling, camping, etc.) and love making music with family and friends. Heather loves to cook and play the piano, and Hannah loves to smile.  My heart’s desire is to join the Holy Spirit as He equips God’s people to join in His mission of proclaiming our King Jesus' gospel (using words if necessary). In other words, I want to make disciples of Jesus. Would you join me? Peace!
