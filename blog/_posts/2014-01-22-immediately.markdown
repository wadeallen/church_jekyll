I have a one track mind. My family would tell you that I am often in another world when I am focused on a particular task. Because of this, I do not like to be interrupted in my work. I like to finish what I have started before I move on to something different. 

In our text this week, Jesus interrupts four men. They are busy making a living (fishing) and Jesus seems to catch them in the middle of their job. Their response could have been, "Hold on Jesus, let me finish this up and I will be with you." In fact, we see this in other places in Scripture. In Luke 9, we find a list of excuse ridden would-be disciples. But these four guys are different. Their response is immediate. We read of Peter and his brother Andrew,

>(Matthew 4:20 NIV) At once they left their nets and followed him.

James and John have the same response,

>(Matthew 4:22 NIV) immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him

My aversion to interruption is challenged in this passage. The response of these men calls us to respond in like ways. The call of God requires us to action. Now. Are we willing for our lives to be interrupted by God? Are we likely to ask God for an extension of time? May we be challenged to hear and obey the voice of God. May our response be as immediate as Peter, Andrew, James and John. Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 4:12â€“23 together.
