I meet with a group of pastors once a month for sharing and prayer. This past month, we met in our church office. It happened to be the same day that I was working on this week's sermon. As we went around the room, I kept hearing one word; it was the word *attacked*. Pastors were sharing about ways in which they felt attacked by the evil one. There seemed to be a disproportionate amount of pressure on the families of the pastors, as well as the pastors themselves. A few hours later, I began working on this sermon. I read,

>(Ephesians 6:10–11 NIV) Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes

Paul reminds us that we are in a battle. The evil one truly attacks. He comes after us. Paul continues,

>(Ephesians 6:12 NIV) For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 

Paul describes rulers and authorities, powers of the dark world. He tells us that they are working against us, against the Kingdom of God. On Sunday, we are going to explore this text. We are going to talk about what it means to put on the armor of God. In a world where a few of us have participated in authentic battle, we may have a hard time grasping this imagery. At the same time, as we explore the battle equipment of the Roman soldier, it sheds light on Paul's intentions in this text. Paul wants us to be prepared, to be ready.

Too often, we failed to understand what is going on around us. We are ill-equipped for the attacks that come our way. May we learn to make provision for the evil around us. May we raise our awareness of the cosmic powers intent on our destruction. May we wear the armor provided for us by the work of Jesus so that we can defeat the adversary. Join us on Sunday as we explore this text.
