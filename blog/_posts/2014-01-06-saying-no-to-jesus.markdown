When I was a kid, I remember a preacher asking if we would be will to do *anything* as long as we were certain that God was calling us. Fearful of ending up in an African hut, I was not sure if I could agree. As I have grown older, I have come to realize that God is worthy of our trust. Yet is is sometimes difficult to follow Him when the path seem unreasonable. Our text this week bring us to a situation where a God-follower is hesitant to heed Jesus's instructions.

Jesus and John had grown up together; they were relatives. In adulthood, John sensed God's calling to move to the desert and live on a diet of locusts and honey. He proclaimed a message of repentance challenging people to respond to God's working in the world. He was busy doing his work when Jesus showed up with a strange request. Jesus wanted John to baptize him. 

It did not make sense to John. He somehow knew that Jesus was sinless; He did not need to be baptized. John felt unworthy.

>(Matthew 3:13–14 NIV) Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”

I find this verse fascinating. The KJV translates this verse,

>(Matthew 3:14 KJV) But John forbad him

To forbid Jesus seems crazy. Most of us would agree that Jesus deserves our obedience. Yet we sometimes we too forbid Him. We reject His direction when it does not seem to fit our plans. Join us on Sunday as we explore this passage together. Matthew 3:13-17
