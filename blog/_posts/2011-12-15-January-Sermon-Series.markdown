It may seem strange to get a newsletter for January before Christmas. However, with vacation schedules, it seemed appropriate to go ahead and mail out a short newsletter for January.

I wanted to let you know about an upcoming sermon series that will begin on January 22. We will be spending five weeks talking about our mission as a church. You may remember talking about this in August; we affirmed a new mission statement at this time. However, we have not spent much time digging deep into this statement. I hope that through this sermon series you will develop a distinctive understanding of who we are and who we are called to be as a church. This past fall, a Ball State student developed artwork around the statement; we will unveil one piece at a time over these five weeks.

You can read through the mission statement documentation at [http://fbcmuncie.org/why-we-exist/](http://fbcmuncie.org/why-we-exist/) . I would encourage you to take a few minutes and read through this description of our mission statement.

>A Spirit-led people **gathered** to **care** for and **empower** each other by **stewarding** God's resources to **impact** our community for Christ

I hope you all have a Merry Christmas and a happy new year. I look forward to serving with you in Christ’s mission in 2012.

Here is a schedule for the series:

- January 22 – Gather
- January 29 – Care
- February 5 – Empower
- February 12 – Steward
- February 19 - Impact
