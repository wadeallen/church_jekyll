A few weeks ago, we were watching home videos. We came across videos of Anna and Dawson's birth. Don't worry; they were not too graphic. As they watched the screen, I wondered how it might feel to experience your birth (even if it is by video). I asked them if it was a little strange to watch the event of their birth. They agreed that it was.

None of us remember the day we were born. At the same time, it was probably one of the most traumatic experiences of our life. We moved from one world to the next. We were comfortable in our mother's womb. We were warm, cozy. Worries of this world were non-existent. In a few moments (or sometimes hours), we transitioned into a world that required us to eat, breath; the world as we knew it was no more. 

This is how Jesus describes our transition into the Kingdom of God. He relates it to a birth. While we do not crawl back into our mother's womb, the transition is no less dramatic. On Sunday, we will overhear a conversation between Jesus and a religious leader named Nicodemus. Nicodemus was trying to figure out who Jesus was. He had seen the miracles and believed that Jesus was from God. Yet he did not know how to sort it  out. Jesus uses his seeking posture as a way to teach us about the dynamics of conversion. Join us on Sunday as we explore John 3:1â€“16.
