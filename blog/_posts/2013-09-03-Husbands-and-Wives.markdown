Marriage is certainly a hot topic word in today's culture. From issues of sexual orientation to a degrading understanding of commitment, we are faced with an ever changing understanding of what it means to be married. As Paul addressed the church at Ephesus, he understood the importance of Christians living in healthy marriages. For the next couple of weeks, our text deals with practical matters of family relationships. As you might remember, Paul wanted Christians to be careful in the way they live.

>(Ephesians 5:15 NIV) Be very careful, then, how you live

How we live in marriage is crucial and merits Paul's attention. He offers instructions to both husbands and wives. He draws an analogy between the husband/wife relationship and the Christ/Church relationship. We will explore the specifics on Sunday (I don't want to spoil the sermon). But for now, let me highlight the importance of healthy marriages. Paul quotes Genesis 2,

>(Ephesians 5:31 NIV) “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”

One body. One flesh. Marriages are a serious joining of two people. How can we make sure they remain strong, in tact? Paul, in Ephesians 5, give us guidance in this endeavor. He calls both the husband and wife toward a selfless posture of sacrifice. I hope you will join us on Sunday as we explore Paul's instructions to husbands and wives.
