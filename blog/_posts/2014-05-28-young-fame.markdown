The stories of young celebrities are predicable. From the childhood stars of the 1960s to modern youngsters such as Miley Cyrus or Justin Bieber, patterns of destructive behavior persist. Psychologists ponder the dynamics.
Most would agree that fame (especially at a young age) can harm. 

In this week's text, we explore the aftermath of David's heroic conquest. David becomes a national hero. He becomes the subject of songs. 

>(1 Samuel 18:6–7 NIV) When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes. As they danced, they sang: “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.”

During this season, we find David's popularity growing. All the while, Saul's jealously and suspicion of David is also rising. Will David's pride get the best of him? Will he finally cash in on his earlier anointing by taking Saul out? David keeps a remarkably level head throughout this season of life. Join us on Sunday as we explore the aftermath of the giant killing in 1 Samuel 18.
