Sunday begins the most significant week on the church calendar. Palm Sunday kicks off the journey of Jesus to the Cross. Certainly, his journey began before Palm Sunday, but this final week of Jesus' life on earth gives us the opportunity to reflect on the intensity of Jesus' suffering. 

The lectionary text this year is very long. It spans across two chapters (Matthew 26-27). We will walk through the story on Sunday. 

A key aspect of this message will be Jesus' ability to call it off at any time. We are told in Matthew 26:53 that Jesus can escape at any moment.  

>(Matthew 26:53 NIV) Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? 

A legion numbers between 3000 and 6000 soldiers. That means that Jesus had up to 72000 angels at his disposal. As we reflect on Jesus' suffering, this fact highlights Jesus' laser focus. He was intent on fulfilling the will of the Father, on carrying out His act of redemption.

I hope that you will plan on spending time next week (Holy Week) in this story. Let me remind you of a special Good Friday service at First Baptist on *Friday, April 18* at First Baptist. Pastor Willie Jackson of Union Missionary Baptist Church will be speaking. We will gather with Christians from all over Muncie to reflect on Jesus' Passion. 

See you on Sunday.
