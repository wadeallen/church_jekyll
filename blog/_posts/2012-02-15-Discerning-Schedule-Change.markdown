In November, we began a discernment process to determine if we should alter our Sunday morning schedule. The Leadership Council spent considerable time exploring options. We entered a three-week period of listening toward the end of November. We examined other church schedules, surveyed the congregation and spent time in prayer. We assembled together around the first of December to discern the Spirit's movement among us. The Council developed a proposed plan that involved a concurrent schedule (9:15 Early Worship/Early Sunday School, 10:15 Fellowship Time, 10:45 Late Worship/Late Sunday School). On January 22 we met as a congregation to discuss this plan. This was an opportunity for feedback and ideas. At the end of this meeting we took a consensus vote to determine how everyone felt about this change. The results of the consensus vote were overwhelmingly supportive of the new schedule.

Therefore, we will initiate the **schedule change on the Sunday following Easter (Sunday, April 15, 2012)**. On Easter we will meet in a combined worship gathering at the new late hour (10:45 a.m.). We will gather at 9:30 a.m. for an all church Easter Breakfast (No Sunday School on Easter). On Sunday, April 15, 2012, we will begin the new schedule:

- 9:15 Early Worship Gathering/Early Sunday School
- 10:15 Fellowship Time
- 10:45 Late Worship Gathering/Late Sunday School

So what about Sunday School? When will the various classes meet?

Here's the plan. During the **early Sunday school hour (9:15 a.m.)**, we will offer two intergenerational Sunday school classes. One class will be topical/issues based from a biblical perspective. The second class will be a Bible study working through various books of the Bible. Current teachers will be asked to teach for set periods of time, depending on their interest and schedule. These classes will provide a place for college students, retirees and all ages in between to sit together in study. Youth and Children's Sunday school (including a nursery) will also take place during the early Sunday school hour. 

During the **late Sunday school hour (10:45 a.m.)**, the Bykota, Two by Two and Friendship classes will meet. There will be a children's church class for younger children, as well as a nursery during this time. 

We may need to make further tweaks as we live in this schedule. We are excited about the new possibilities this schedule offers. A full hour for Sunday school, consistent start/end times for everyone, and a full half-hour fellowship time are a few of the advantages for this schedule.

Please continue to keep this change in your prayers. Change is never easy; this is substantial change for our congregation. However, we will find God's provision as we follow his leading.
