For several weeks I have been preparing for the upcoming sermon series; I am eager to finally begin on Sunday. The series is going to be on the life of David. No doubt, David's life is a roller coaster. It will be nice to step through the various stages of his life at a fairly slow pace. We will spend 20+ weeks in this series.

On Sunday, we will look at the back story to David's life. It is important to understand the context in which his life is set. It will provide the necessary tools for the coming weeks.

As we consider the significance and reach of this man's life, we wonder why God chose him. David is mentioned (in the New Testament) more than any other Old Testament person. His songs (and poetry) comprises over half of the recorded psalms in Scripture. His Kingdom is eternal and continues with Jesus on the throne. One could make the case that he is one of the more notable people in history. In Acts 13, Paul describes David.

>(Acts 13:22 NIV) I have found David son of Jesse a man after my own heart

As we consider David's life, we will keep coming back to this description. What does it mean to be a person after God's own heart? As we will discover, David is far from perfect. His mistakes/sins are colossal; yet his passion for God is immense. To be after God's heart is not about perfection; it is more about relationship. David loves God and serves Him with all his heart. 

I am hopeful that God will teach us more about what it means to follow Him as we study David. May God pour out His Spirit on this study. I hope you will join us on Sunday as we begin.
