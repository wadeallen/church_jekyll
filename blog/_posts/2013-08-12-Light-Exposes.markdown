Throughout history, images of light and darkness have been used to describe good and bad. From evil villains to angelic beings, we have associated the images of light (white) and darkness (black) with opposing sides. Yet in this week's text, we see another dimension of this image.

Paul describes what we (Christians) have experienced. 

>(Ephesians 5:8 NIV)  For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.

We have heard this before. Throughout Scripture, we are told that God is light and the evil one is dark. As God's children, we are brought into the light. But there is more to this description. Paul describes light as having the power to expose darkness.

>(Ephesians 5:13â€“14 NIV) But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for it is light that makes everything visible.

Not only is dark evil, but it is in the business of hiding truth. Can you think of the hidden aspects of evil in our world? From lies about our sexuality to mistruths regarding the fulfillment of material goods, we are often tricked by evil. For example, what is described as casual sex is anything but casual. God's design for sexuality cannot be reduced to a physical act. Partners are left with emotional baggage and scars that last a lifetime. Or consider those who are hoodwinked into believing that our lives consist of possessions. Millionaires find lives void of meaning and substance. They are left wondering if there is more to life.

Paul tells us that light exposes darkness. In other words, God's truth has the power to reveal the lies of the evil one. Join us on Sunday as we discuss the ramifications of living lives of light. May we be challenged to brighten the dark places of our world with the light of God.
