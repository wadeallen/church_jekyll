What does it mean to be blessed? We all want blessings; we want to live a blessed life. But what do we mean? If we pressed the issue, many of us would define the word as having to do with economic success or a life free of pain and suffering. We might even speak of having family and friends who support us. These are the typical ways we define *blessings*.

But when Jesus shows up and considers the *blessed*, he has entirely different categories. In this week's text (Matthew 5:1-12), we will be exploring what many refer to as *The Beatitudes* (Latin for Blessings). Jesus' description of *the blessed* may surprise you. In fact we often consider those in his sermon cursed. His message flies in the face of our cultural understanding of *blessed*

Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 5:1-12 together. I would encourage you to take few minutes to read the passage as you prepare for worship.
