We just returned from a great weekend in Wisconsin with the teenagers; it was a great time to connect with them. The speaker talked about apologetics (defending our faith). Teens are often faced with friends who do not believe in God. The speaker gave our teens tools for conversation with their friends on such issues. Thanks to Doug Gregg for preaching on Sunday in my absence.

As we gather for worship this Sunday, we begin a five-week series on our mission as a church. We will talk about the importance of gathering. As we find ourselves frequently communicating digitally, we find ourselves in less physical conversation. Sure, there are many advantages to social networks and digital communication. However, I wonder if we are missing something.

As you might remember, our mission statement is:

>A Spirit-led people gathered to care for and empower each other by stewarding God's resources to impact our community for Christ

We are a people, led by the Holy Spirit. But we are not just led by the Holy Spirit; we are gathered. Our gathering takes shape in at least three ways. We will explore these ways on Sunday. I will not spoil it for you now.

However, I would like to leave you with the words of the author of Hebrews. Don't forget, early Christians risked much in order to gather. In many places, it was forbidden for them to gather. Yet the author of Hebrews encourages Christians to take the risk.

>(Hebrews 10:24–25 NIV) And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another — and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

Join us on Sunday as we explore the critical necessity of coming together.
