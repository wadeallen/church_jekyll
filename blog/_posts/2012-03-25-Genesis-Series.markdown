I have enjoyed time in the Psalms through the Lenten season. I have gained a new appreciation for this treasury of devotions. The psalms gift us with insight from ancient worshipers; they give us the human/divine encounter from the human side. So what is next?

After Easter, we will spend time in the book of Genesis. I wanted to give you a peek into where we are going in this study. We could easily spend several years in this book. It is a lengthy account of the beginning of the world through the period of the Patriarchs. However, we only plan to spend about 20-25 weeks in the book. 

Genesis might be divided into two major sections. The ESV Study Bible suggests a two-part division: Primeval History (1:1–11:26)  and Patriarchal History (11:27–50:26). The first section begins with Creation and goes to the story of Abraham. The second part picks up with Abraham and covers the story of his family through Joseph. We will spend about nine weeks in the first part (finishing it up around Father's Day); the second part should take us into the fall. We will not cover every verse; rather we will select passages attempting to maintain the flow of the book.

You might want to note that an intergenerational Sunday school class will be available during each Sunday school hour to engage the story on a deeper level. Here is a tentative plan for the first part of the study. I provide it for you in hopes that you will read ahead and prepare to engage the Scripture together in the coming weeks.

- 4/15 In the Beginning (Genesis 1:1-25)
- 4/22 The 7th Day (Genesis 2:1–4)
- Randy Gruendyke from Taylor University will be with us on April 29
- 5/6 Eden (Genesis 2:4–17)
- 5/13 Creating Woman (Genesis 2:18–25) *Mother's Day
- 5/20 The Fall (Genesis 3:1-24)
- 5/27 The Wickedness of Humanity (Genesis 6:1-8)
- 6/3 Noah (Genesis 6-9)
- 6/10 The Tower (Genesis 11:1-8)
- 6/17 A Father's Legacy (Genesis 11:10-32)
