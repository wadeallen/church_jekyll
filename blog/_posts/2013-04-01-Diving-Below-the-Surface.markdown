It was wonderful to worship as a gathered body this past Sunday. Celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus on this high Sunday was invigorating. With Easter Sunday behind us, we move together into a study of Ephesians. 

We have much work to do as a church family. Adapting to unparalleled change in our culture, we must discern together God's leading. We have at least two groups in our church discerning issues of resources. As we seek the leading of the Spirit, it is crucial to remain centered in God's Word. Our study in Ephesians will aid our understanding of who we are called to be as the people of God. This week, we will explore Ephesians 1:3-13, considering foundational tenets of our worship.

I have to admit, this text is deep. Paul peeks into the eternal purposes of God and describes our role in His plan. While diving below the surface is sometimes challenging, it is essential that we comprehend the magnificence of what God has done for us. It involves understanding that we were doomed without Jesus; yet through his shed blood, we experience tremendous blessing. As we grasp these truths, our natural response is worship. On Sunday, we will consider our redemption. We will probe into the richness of God's work through Jesus. I hope that you will take a few minutes to read Ephesians 1:3-13 as you prepare for worship on Sunday. 

Paul's letter to the Ephesians provides a full and clear picture of how the church should function. He reminds us our glorious salvation and our appropriate response as we join God in His mission. I look forward to studying this epistle with you.
