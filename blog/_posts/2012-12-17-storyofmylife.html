<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a trend.  After recently donning some new leadership and life roles, many good-natured folks have inquired about what I&#8217;ve done with my life lately (besides create the illusion of a perpetual chaotic furor). What you&#8217;re reading is one attempt towards bucking this trend.</p>

<p>I believe good leaders tell stories. While I don&#8217;t have the strongest track record for consistent updates on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MatthewPaulHeadley">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/mattheadley">Twitter</a>, I&#8217;m planning to regularly carve out time to tell stories here of what God is up to in my life and ministry.  Here goes.</p>

<p>Four big things began in my life between July and October of 2012.</p>

<ul class="square-list">
<li>July: Youth Ministry. I was called to join the staff a parachurch organization called Muncie Area Youth for Christ <a href="http://www.yfc.net/">(YFC)</a> as the coordinator for a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MuncieCentralCampusLife">&#8220;Campus Life&#8221;</a> ministry in the Muncie Central High School community.</li>
<li>August: Church Leadership. After three years of serving <a href="http://fbcmuncie.org">First Baptist Church of Muncie</a> as a worship arts director, I was called to serve as an associate pastor, broadening my previous leadership role to include outreach ministry.</li>
<li>September: Parenthood. My wife and I met Hannah Joy, an amazing new person who is also our first child.  Three words: Beautiful. Scary. Hilarious.</li>
<li>October: Education. For the grand finale of my journey through an M.Div. with <a href="http://www.seminary.edu/">Northern Seminary</a>, I began a chaplaincy internship with the gifted staff in the spiritual care department at Ball Memorial Hospital.</li>
</ul>

<p>These new commitments have presented me with some exciting and formidable challenges. I&#8217;ve been humbled by the patience and grace friends around me have extended as I work to balance these commitments out. I hope that, as I tell my story and how God is working through it, you will see him moving in your own life, in our community, and maybe even the world. 
Peace!</p>
