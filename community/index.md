Missional Communities are underway at First Baptist. We have completed our pilot community in February - May of 2013. We are breaking for a two month reflection and evaluation peroid (June - July 2013).

Please take a few minutes to read this June 2013 Visitor Article.

As we near the end of May, we come to the close of our pilot missional community. We have experienced an increased connectedness through Life Groups and service. I wanted to take a few minutes to give you an update on where we are and where we are going in this endeavor.

## What Happened?

After much planning and praying, we began our pilot missional community in February. With over 30 participants, we maintained a monthly schedule of meeting as a large group on the first Wednesday of each month. On the second week of each month, we met in Life groups. On the third week of the month, we served together on a community mission project. On the fourth week, we once again met in Life groups. Life Group leaders also met on the first and third Wednesday of each month for training and support.

Life Groups provided a place for care and challenge in smaller groups. Each group had less than ten people. Most of the groups met in homes. While four months is not enough time to build relationships, groups began to bond as they shared meals and discussion twice each month. In this pilot community, we had four life groups.

Large group meetings provided an opportunity for groups to mingle, reflect and share stories of what God was doing in the smaller Life Groups. While attendance varied at large group gathering, participants were able to interact with a broader circle. We sometimes sang together, prayed together and shared life experiences with one another.

Community Mission projects provided an opportunity to serve together. We participated in four mission projects. In February, we gathered at the Muncie Mission to organize canned goods. In March, we partnered with Blood and Fire in their weekly food distribution. We also assisted in their community outreach during Muncie Gras. In April, we partnered with Teamwork For Quality Living in a personal care drive. We collected and distributed items that are not covered by government welfare programs. In May, we served together cleaning Westside Park in Muncie. Monthly mission projects were organized by Life Groups.

## What is Next?

During the months of June and July, Life Group leaders will gather to reflect, evaluate and plan. We have distributed a churchwide survey to assess Life Group participation. Team members are working to organize child care options for the fall. Pilot or test programs give us an opportunity to try new systems. However, it is important that we take the necessary time to evaluate and adapt to our learnings. More information about the fall missional community will be available the next month.

## How Can You Be Involved?

At this point, your involvement in the missional community can be through prayer. We hope that you will pray for the leaders as they determine necessary adaptations for the fall. At the same time, we hope that you will pray about your involvement in the next group. The plan is to continue with one missional community group (up to 50 people) for August through November. Many of the Life Groups will remain intact; new Life Groups will be established based on interest. 
The missional community pilot group provided a great start. We have learned, served together and developed leaders. We look forward to continue development of this ministry in the months and years to come.
