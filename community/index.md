The Spring 2014 session has started. Life groups are in place. Feel free to read about the Missional Community group and join us on the first and/or third weeks of the month.

You can subscribe the the [Missional Community Calendar](/community/calendar) on your computer, smart phone or tablet to keep up the various gatherings.

The schedule is as follows:

## Week One

On the first Sunday of the month, we will gather for a social event. The purpose of these events is to connect with others in the Missional Community. The events will be advertized in the bulletin and newsletter. It is a great way to spend time with others in the church family.

## Week Two

Life Groups will meet in homes.

## Week Three

A Mission Project is organized by one of the Life groups. You can find out more about this month's mission project on the [weekly news](http://fbcmuncie.org/news/) page.

## Week Four

Life Groups will meet in homes.


## Week Five (only on certain months)

On fifth weeks, there will be no MC events. We encourage everyone to spend time with family, neighbors or friends during this week.
