Missional Communities are underway at First Baptist. We are beginning our pilot community in February. This community will operate for four months and then break for a period of time to assess what we have learned.

If you're interested in being a part of the community, open group meetings are the first and third week of every month.

On the first Wednesday of every month, we will meet from 6:00 to 7:00 PM in the lower auditorium. A meal will be served at 5:30 PM.

On the third week of each month, we will participate in a mission project together. To find out more about this month mission project, check out the [weekly news page](/news).

Schedule is as follows:

- The first Wednesday of each month, we gather for a shared meal and large group discussion. We will learn more about what it means to be on mission with God. This will be a time to meet others who are involved in the community who may not be in your smaller group.

- On the second and fourth week of each month, Life Groups will meet in homes. Life Group sign-up is closed for the pilot community. It will reopen in the summer.

- On the third week of each month, mission project will take place. Check out the [weekly news page](/news) for more information about this month's project.

We are in the process of learning more about these sorts of communities. I hope that you will consider joining us and learning alongside of us what it means to follow Jesus.
