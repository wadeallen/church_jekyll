Missional Communities are underway at First Baptist. We have completed our pilot community in February - May of 2013. After taking a two month break for evaluation and planning, we have started the Fall session (August - November).

The schedule is as follows (the first week of the month begins with the first Sunday of the month):

## Week One

On the first week of the month (the first week begins with the first Sunday of the month), we will gather on Wednesday evening for a meal and family worship. This is a time to bring your favorite dish and your children for a shared meal and worship. We will keep the environment kid friendly. The purpose of these gatherings is to connect with others in the Missional Community.

## Week Two

Life Groups will meet in homes.

## Week Three

A Mission Project is organized by one of the Life groups. You can find out more about this month's mission project on the [weekly news](http://fbcmuncie.org/news/) page.

## Week Four

Life Groups will meet in homes.


## Week Five (only on certain months)

On fifth weeks, there will be no MC events. We encourage everyone to spend time with family, neighbors or friends during this week.
