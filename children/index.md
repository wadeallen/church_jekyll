title: Children's Ministry
---

The Children’s Ministry at FBC is led by a team of dedicated individuals
who dearly love the youngest members of the church body. From infancy
through 5th grade, this group addresses the spiritual, emotional and
physical needs of these children through Biblical teaching, play areas
with appropriate toys, esthetically pleasing rooms, and caring competent
teens and adults from the church who have passed background checks.

During both morning services, nurseries for infants/creepers and
toddlers are provided. The infants and creepers room is separate from
the toddler room. In an adjoining room, three and four year olds have
Sunday School during first service and additional teaching and play
during second service.

Sunday School is held during first service for children and teens.
During second service, children in Kindergarten through 2nd grade have
the option of attending Children’s Church. Children leave the regular
worship service following the opening song set for their own worship
time.

Throughout the year, fun activities are planned for the children,
usually one each quarter. This may include a trip to the zoo, vacation
Bible school, music camp at the church, picnic in the park, birthday
party for Jesus, etc. A week at Tippecanoe summer camp is available for
the elementary ages.

During the academic year, a Wednesday evening Bible class including
children’s choir and activity time is offered for K-5th graders. Infant
and toddler nursery is also available at the same time while parents
participate in other Wednesday evening programs of the church.

Volunteers are welcomed and encouraged to help. It is important for the
children to appreciate and develop relationships with the teens and
adult members of the congregation.

Goals of the Children’s Ministry are for the children to:

-   realize their need for salvation, come to love Jesus and accept Him
    as their Savior
-   get to know God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) through the Bible
-   develop a desire and knowledge of how to worship God
-   respond to Jesus’ love through obedience
-   grow in love and care for other people (friends, family, others)
-   understand the need & be given the opportunity to extend Jesus’ love
    to those in need
-   be ready and willing to tell others about Jesus
