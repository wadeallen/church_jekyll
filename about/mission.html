	  <p>We are people who are gathered by the Holy Spirit</p>

	  <p>We are each called to this time and place to live in community with one another pointing to the cross of Christ</p>

	  <h3 id="incarnational_physical">Incarnational (Physical)</h3>

	  <p>Because God chose to be with us in the flesh, we are also called to be among each other. (Phil. 2:5-11)</p>

	  <p>Our gathering is physical, incarnational. We are the body of Christ.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another — and all the more as you see the Day approaching.  (Heb 10:25 NIV)
	  Our gathering celebrates our unique giftedness in Christ</p>

	  <p>The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ.  (1 Cor 12:12 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <h3 id="trinitarian_unified">Trinitarian (Unified)</h3>

	  <p>Because God is three in one, we are called to be one. Even in our diversity, we are to have the mind of Christ. (John 14:9-12)</p>

	  <p>Our gathering models the community of the Triune God.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.  (Deut 6:4 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>Our gathering promotes one mind, the mind of Christ</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought. (1 Cor 1:10 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <h3 id="eschatological_future_oriented">Eschatological (Future Oriented)</h3>

	  <p>Because God has a plan for the future, we are called to live into His plan. (Jer. 29:11)</p>

	  <p>Our gathering reminds us of who we are, and who we are to become</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.  (1 Pet 2:9 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>Our gathering points future generations to the Kingdom of God</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>18) Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the LORD: 19) “The LORD looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth, 20) to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.” 21) So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem 22) when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD. (Psa 102:18–22 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>Worship is the primary gathering setting for the people of First Baptist. While there are Sunday school classes, small group, and many opportunities for ministry, we believe that worship is the foremost gathering of the people of God. Join us for either traditional (9:15 a.m.) or contemporary (11:15 a.m.) worship each Sunday morning.</p>

	  <p>We are called to care for one another</p>

	  <p>Because God has loved us, we are called to love one another</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>If anyone says, “I love God,” yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.  (1 John 4:20 NIV)
	  When we are hurting, we share in each other&#8217;s pain</p>

	  <p>3) Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, 4) who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God. (2 Cor 1:3–4 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>When we are struggling, we lift each other up.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. (Gal 6:2 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>When God makes us strong, we share our strength with each other</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.  (1 John 2:14 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>When we falter, we serve as accountable agents to each other</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds (Heb 10:24 NIV)</p>

	  <p>We are called to live into the Kingdom of God. As we gather, we are called to empower each other for Kingdom living. We call this process discipleship.</p>

	  <p>We are empowered by God (2 Tim 1:7 NIV) and empowering each other by &#8230; </p>

	  <p>engaging <strong>Scripture</strong> together</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>16) All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17) so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.  (2 Tim 3:16–17 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>sharing our <strong>stories</strong>, our testimonies</p>

	  <p><strong>praying</strong> for one another</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.  (Eph 6:18 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>prompting each other in <strong>spiritual disciplines</strong></p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>7) train yourself to be godly. For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.  (1 Tim 4:7–8 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>discerning and utilizing our <strong>spiritual gifts</strong></p>

	  <p>All that we have is God&#8217;s. It has been entrusted to us for His purposes. We are called to utilize these resources for the building of His Kingdom.</p>

	  <p>The resources that God has entrusted to the church are:</p>

	  <p>Creation, Spiritual Gifts, People, Property, Time, Technology, Money</p>

	  <p>We are called to carefully discern the management of these resources.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>The earth is the LORD’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;  (Psa 24:1 NIV)
	  offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God — this is your spiritual act of worship. (Rom 12:1 NIV)</p>

	  <p>“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20) But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. (Matt 6:19–20 NIV)</p>

	  <p>Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. 7) Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 8) And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.  (2 Cor 9:6–8 NIV)</p>

	  <p>Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children 2) and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.  (Eph 5:1 NIV)
	  And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.  (Heb 13:16 NIV)</p>

	  <p>If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him? 18) Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.  (1 John 3:17–18 NIV)</p>

	  <p>God desires that all people be reconciled to Himself. He has sent Jesus, His Son as the Messiah, this is the gospel (the good news). Jesus&#8217; life, death on the cross and resurrection provides life and reconciliation with God. We are called to proclaim this message to the world. Through relationships, we are called to share this good news.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.  (John 3:16 NIV)</p>

	  <p>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20) and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”  (Matt 28:19–20 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <h3 id="pursuing_social_justice">Pursuing Social Justice</h3>

	  <p>God&#8217;s desire is that the world would be made right. Participating in God&#8217;s redeeming work requires us to engage the social injustices of our world.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.  (Mic 6:8 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>We are called to engage areas of injustice in our world. Those who are suffering the effects of poverty and racism are all around us. We are called to step into those places with the love of Christ.</p>

	  <h3 id="caring_for_creation">Caring for Creation</h3>

	  <p>God created all things and calls us to care for His creation.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” (Gen 1:28 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>God is in the process of restoring all creation. We join him as we care for our environment.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>19) The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. 20) For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope 21) that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. 22) We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.  (Rom 8:19–22 NIV)</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  <h3 id="transforming_our_culture">Transforming our Culture</h3>

	  <p>God is transforming all areas of culture. As we live in our community, we are called to be salt and light. We are doctors, waitresses, factory workers, school teachers, nurses, beauticians, businessmen, trainers, secretaries, counselors, and more. God works through us to do his work in the world.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God — this is your spiritual act of worship. 2) Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is — his good, pleasing and perfect will.  (Rom 12:1–2 NIV)</p>
