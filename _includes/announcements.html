<p>There will be a combined service on <strong>Sunday, November 24</strong> along with an all-church pitch-in lunch following the service. Everyone will attend Sunday school during the early hour and worship together during the second hour. Please bring a dish to share and join us for a time of fellowship and sharing. During the lunch, there will be a brief time for church business to celebrate all that God is doing at First Baptist.</p>
<p>Following the Harvest Dinner, everyone is invited to spend a few minutes decorating the church. There will be brief singing and scripture reading, and then everyone will work together to finish the decorating. It is wonderful if responsible children can be part of this tradition as well.</p>
