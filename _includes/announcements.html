<p>One element of the new missional communities is Life Groups. Life Groups are groups of 6-12 people meeting in homes. Life Groups will meet on the 2nd and 4th week of each month. If you would be interested in joining a Life Group, please sign up by January 20. Once the Missional Communities begin, Life Groups will be closed until the next session begins (probably in the Fall). This will keep the Life Groups static so that relationships can be formed.</p>
