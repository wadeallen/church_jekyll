<h2 class="title"id="missional-communities">Missional Communities<span class="line"></span></h2>
<p>Missional Communities at First Baptist Muncie began at the beginning of 2013. The ministry runs from February-May (taking a two-month break in the summer) and from August-November (taking a two-month break in the winter). This month, we begin our winter break. Life group leaders will meet during this time to evaluate and discuss the Spring term plans. Please keep this team in your prayers as they work through December and January to prayerfully consider God’s leading for 2014. If you have not been a part of the Missional Community, let me encourage you to consider being involved in 2014. Missional Communities are for anyone and all ages in the church. If you would be interested in being a part of a group in the Spring, please let Wade know.</p>

## Epiphany Cookies for Muncie Mission


One of the symbols of the season of Epiphany is a star. On **Sunday, January 19**, in observance of the Epiphany season and its meaning, (the revelation of Christ as the light of the world) please bring homemade star-shaped cookies in a sealed plastic bag to our worship gatherings. These will be given to the men at the Muncie Mission as a gift from our church to share the love of Jesus.

<h2 class="title"id="christmas-eve-service">Christmas Eve Service<span class="line"></span></h2>
<p>The candlelight Christmas Eve service at First Baptist Church Muncie is a highlight of the Christmas season. We will gather at <strong>7:00 PM</strong> on <strong>Christmas Eve</strong> to kick off Christmas celebrations in a beautifully decorated sanctuary. As we light the Christmas eve candle, we remember the reason for our celebration. The story of Christmas (Luke 2:1-20) is placed in the context of Christ’s sacrifice for us. There is no more appropriate way to begin Christmas than by receiving the most precious gift, His body broken for us and His blood shed for us.</p>
