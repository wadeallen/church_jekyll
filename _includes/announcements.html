<p>The Missional Communities are on a two-month break (June-July). Life groups may continue to meet for fellowship during the summer months. However, no social events or service projects are scheduled for June/July. Group leaders use this time to evaluate and plan for the coming session. The fall session will begin in August. If you are interested in joining a life group in the fall session, let Wade or a life group leader know. Please keep leaders in your prayers this summer as they discern direction for the fall.</p>
<!-- Life groups meet this week in homes as it is the fourth week of the month.
