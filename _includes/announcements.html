<p>The Missional Communities are on a two-month break (June-July). Life groups may continue to meet for fellowship during the summer months.

If you are interested in joining a life group in the fall session, let Wade or a life group leader know. Please keep leaders in your prayers this summer as they discern direction for the fall.</p>
<!-- Life groups meet this week in homes as it is the fourth week of the month.

<p>Because our church focuses on ministry to those in poverty, you may want to add an experience to your tool belt to help you better understand what people in poverty face. A Poverty Simulation will be hosted next door at the <strong>YWCA</strong> on <strong>Tuesday, June 24</strong> from <strong>4-6:15 PM</strong>. You will be assigned an identity and asked to try to survive four “weeks” in poverty walking in that person’s shoes. Nearly 100% of the 4,000-plus who have participated would definitely recommend this learning opportunity to a friend. Open to anyone aged 10 to 90. Call  or e-mail  by this coming Friday, June 20, to reserve a spot. (Must have a reservation to be included.)</p>
