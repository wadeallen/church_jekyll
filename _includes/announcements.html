<h2 class="title"id="missional-communities">Missional Communities<span class="line"></span></h2>
<p>Missional Communities at First Baptist Muncie began at the beginning of 2013. The ministry runs from February-May (taking a two-month break in the summer) and from August-November (taking a two-month break in the winter). This month, we continue our winter break. Life group leaders will meet during this time to evaluate and discuss the Spring term plans. Please keep this team in your prayers as they work through this month to prayerfully consider God’s leading for 2014. If you have not been a part of the Missional Community, let me encourage you to consider being involved in 2014. Missional Communities are for anyone and all ages in the church. If you would be interested in being a part of a group in the Spring, please let Wade know by <strong>Sunday, January 26</strong>.</p>
