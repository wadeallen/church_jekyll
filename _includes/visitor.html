<p><em>Wade Allen</em></p>
<p>When I was engaged in my doctoral work at Northern Seminary, I read extensively about the ways in which culture and the church are shifting. You don't have to be a seminary student to see that both society and the church are changing. Sociologists will tell you that younger generations are less active in the life of the church. The numbers vary, yet the decline is anything but minimal. Some reports indicate that church attendance has moved from 65% in the Builder generation to only 4% in the current generation of twenty-somethings. How is the church going to respond?</p>
<p>One of the books in my studies was written by Eddie Gibbs,; it is entitled <em>ChurchNext: Quantum Changes in How We Do Ministry</em>. The book was written in 2000 (it is almost 13 years old); yet his predictions have proved to be accurate. Gibbs describes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the following chapters is to attempt to identify some of the major storm centers through which churches have to navigate. (Gibbs, 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it would be impossible to detail the entire book in this article, Gibbs describes the need to experiment with different models of ministry. He explains essential skill-sets for pastors that include deciphering the complex changes in our world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pastors must be equally skilled in exegeting both Scripture and culture, bringing the understanding derived from this interplay to the task of applying biblically grounded insights to the issues of postmodernity. They are challenged not just to be able to think clearly but to have the nerve and faith to act decisively in navigating through stormy and uncharted waters. (Gibbs, 32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the waters of our world are stormy. We will not be able to continue business as usual. We will need to discern God's Spirit as we respond to our changing culture. Gibbs describes the posture of the congregation as willing to take risks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a culture of chaos, experimentation and risk taking are the order of the day. (Gibbs, 34)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could Gibbs be right? Could it be that we will need to take more risks than our fathers and grandfathers? Could it be that we need to discard the old adage, &quot;we've always done it that way before,&quot; if we want to survive? This year, we may be faced with difficult decisions as a congregation. Budgetary constraints may force us to reconsider how we utilize our resources. We may need to discontinue or reform ministries that have existed for years. I ask each attendee and member to prayerfully consider a new posture of flexibility and risk. It may be the only way to chart the treacherous waters of today's world.</p>
<p>A pilot missional community will begin in February. The first large group Missional Community meeting will be on <strong>February 6, 6:00 PM</strong> in the lower auditorium. Participants have signed up for smaller groups, called <em>life groups</em> and will meet the second and fourth weeks of the month. On the third week of each month, a mission project will be organized for all participants of the missional community. Everyone is invited to join the group on the first and third week of each month. Monthly mission projects will be advertised in the bulletin.</p>

<p>On Sunday, January 13, constitutional revisions were adopted by the congregation. You can download a new copy of the Constitution from the church website. Changes included a name change for the primary leadership group of the church. The <em>Leadership Council</em> is now called the <em>Church Coordination Team</em>. <em>Ministry Leaders</em> are now called <em>Area Coordinators</em>. It may take some time to adjust to the new language. However, as you see this new language published, you will understand what it means.</p>
<p>In addition, the changes divided the area of Christian Education into three areas. We now have Adult Ministry, Youth Ministry and Children Ministry areas.</p>
<p>Everyone is invited to attend a luncheon on Sunday, February 10 to honor Levi Allen's baptism. Levi was baptized on December 30. However, due to the holiday, it was decided to hold the luncheon at a later date. The luncheon will follow the late worship/Sunday school hour.</p>
<p>Brittany or Katie will write this up.</p>
<p>You may pick up a printed directory at either door of the sanctuary as you leave today. There will also be copies in the church office.</p>
<p>We have updated the website to a new format for use on mobile devices. Please check it out and let us know what you think and if anything needs to be added to the site.</p>
<p>So far in 2013, we have been focusing on stewardship. It is no secret that we are suffering the loss of financial support as aged members are passing away and/or moving into assisted living facilities. But stewardship is more than dollars. It is about fully offering ourselves to God. We are engaging Scripture around this topic together in this New Year. We hope that you will continue to join us in this important series as we study Scripture together. The first two weeks in February will compete our Stewardship Series.</p>

<p>Soozi Whitten Ford will be preaching in worship on February 3. Her special interest in the area of stewardship makes her preaching particularly relevant at this time.
