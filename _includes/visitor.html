<p>When I was engaged in my doctoral work at Northern Seminary, I read extensively about the ways in which culture and the church are shifting. You don't have to be a seminary student to see that both society and the church are changing. Sociologists will tell you that younger generations are less active in the life of the church. The numbers vary, yet the decline is anything but minimal. Some reports indicate that church attendance has moved from 65% in the Builder generation to only 4% in the current generation of twenty-somethings. How is the church going to respond?</p>
<p>One of the books in my studies was written by Eddie Gibbs; it is entitled <em>ChurchNext: Quantum Changes in How We Do Ministry</em>. The book was written in 2000 (it is almost 13 years old); yet his predictions have proved to be accurate. Gibbs describes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the following chapters is to attempt to identify some of the major storm centers through which churches have to navigate. (Gibbs, 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it would be impossible to detail the entire book in this article, Gibbs describes the need to experiment with different models of ministry. He explains essential skill-sets for pastors that include deciphering the complex changes in our world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pastors must be equally skilled in exegeting both Scripture and culture, bringing the understanding derived from this interplay to the task of applying biblically grounded insights to the issues of postmodernity. They are challenged not just to be able to think clearly but to have the nerve and faith to act decisively in navigating through stormy and uncharted waters. (Gibbs, 32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the waters of our world are stormy. We will not be able to continue business as usual. We will need to discern God's Spirit as we respond to our changing culture. Gibbs describes the posture of the congregation as willing to take risks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a culture of chaos, experimentation and risk taking are the order of the day. (Gibbs, 34)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could Gibbs be right? Could it be that we will need to take more risks than our fathers and grandfathers? Could it be that we need to discard the old adage, &quot;we've always done it that way before,&quot; if we want to survive? This year, we may be faced with difficult decisions as a congregation. Budgetary constraints may force us to reconsider how we utilize our resources. We may need to discontinue or reform ministries that have existed for years. I ask each attendee and member to prayerfully consider a new posture of flexibility and risk. It may be the only way to chart the treacherous waters of today's world.</p>

<p>Recently I was visiting a senior adult member of one of our two churches. This was a person who was no longer able to attend in person, but who definitely remained with us in spirit on a regular and faithful basis. As I was leaving, I was asked to wait a minute. The checkbook was opened and filled out. Then I was given a check, the tithe for the month. “Take this with you. It will save me the postage to mail it in.” I did not look at it. I did not want to know the exact amount on the check. It would have been like violating something very sacred. I later gave the check to someone who handles finances for the church.</p>
<p>This was not an isolated event. It is repeated regularly, not in just one home but many. Some are in nursing homes, assisted living, or in their own homes where advancing age has confined them. While they are no longer able to attend in person, they are very much still with us, in their thoughts, prayers, and tithes (which some can barely afford). In a very real way, these good people are the backbone of the church. They built it. They love it. They support it. If even their financial support were no longer, the ability of the church to do mission would be compromised. They should be honored, loved, and cared for. In fact, all of our senior adults form a vital part of the church. They deserve the best we can give them.</p>
<p>As shared earlier in this space, the Riverside/First Baptist Committee is taking on the challenge to oversee the ministry of our two churches to our senior adults. Terry Harke chairs this committee. Those on this committee include Mary Harry, Bill Stevens, Jane Patton, and Barb Wilson. Shirley Pittenger has agreed to also join us. I am an Ex-officio member. They will meet again on February 13, this time for the express purpose of discussing ways to strengthen our ministry to senior adults. Please feel free to share your own ideas with them.</p>
<p>There is great potential there. We have excellent (and accessible) facilities at two locations. We have an active pool of faithful members at both locations. There is a tradition of ministries in the past (including worship to which persons of this generation can relate). In addition to active members in both churches, we are in a community with a growing aging population. (Muncie is-well positioned as a retirement community, given affordable housing, proximity to a major university, etc.). The time is right to move in this direction. This is a field that is ripe for harvest. These are people that deserve the best we can give. We solicit your prayers, and your best ideas!</p>
<p>A pilot missional community will begin in February. The first large group Missional Community meeting will be on <strong>February 6, 6:00 PM</strong> in the lower auditorium. Participants have signed up for smaller groups, called <em>life groups</em> and will meet the second and fourth weeks of the month. On the third week of each month, a mission project will be organized for all participants of the missional community. Everyone is invited to join the group on the first and third week of each month. Monthly mission projects will be advertised in the bulletin.</p>
<p>Children in Preschool through 5th grade, and their families, are invited to Pizza Hut following the church service on <strong>February 3</strong>. This will be a time for fellowship with adults while the children enjoy hanging out as well. Please RSVP to Christy 765-717-5229 (call or text) wadechristy@gmail.com (email) by February 2nd so we know how much pizza to order. Pizza, Drinks, and Dessert will be provided at no cost to you.</p>
<p>Children's Church will begin next <strong>Sunday February 3</strong> during the Late Worship Gathering. Children's Church will be for children in kindergarten through 2nd grade. The children will be dismissed before the sermon to the basement classroom for their worship time. Jessica Fink &amp; Kelly Richard are co-coordinating and teaching. If you have any questions or if you would like to introduce yourself to us, please feel free to do so.</p>
<p>Feb 9, 2013 at the Muncie Field House, check-in at 8:00am. For more info, see http://www.munciemission.org/walk-a-mile/2013-walk-a-mile/</p>
<p>On the third week of each month, we will have a service project for the pilot missional community. This month, we will be working at the Muncie Mission. On <strong>Tuesday, February 19</strong>, we will be serving a meal and helping sort items at the mission.

<p>On Sunday, January 13, constitutional revisions were adopted by the congregation. You can download a new copy of the Constitution from the church website. Changes included a name change for the primary leadership group of the church. The <em>Leadership Council</em> is now called the <em>Church Coordination Team</em>. <em>Ministry Leaders</em> are now called <em>Area Coordinators</em>. It may take some time to adjust to the new language. However, as you see this new language published, you will understand what it means.</p>
<p>In addition, the changes divided the area of Christian Education into three areas. We now have Adult Ministry, Youth Ministry and Children Ministry areas.</p>
<p>Everyone is invited to attend a luncheon on <strong>Sunday, February 10</strong> to honor Levi Allen's baptism. Levi was baptized on December 30. However, due to the holiday, it was decided to hold the luncheon at a later date. The luncheon will follow the late worship/Sunday school hour.</p>
<p>Need a babysitter for Valentine’s Day? The youth will be holding a babysitting fundraiser at the church on <strong>Friday, February 15th from 6:30-9:30</strong>. Youth and leaders will be at the church to watch kids so that couples can have the opportunity to have a night out. We are accepting donations and would like to request a minimum of $10 per child for the evening. We will have an evening snack, but dinner will not be provided. Please sign up so we know how many children to expect. Enjoy a night out while helping support our youth!</p>
<p>The youth will gather at the Morency house on <strong>Sunday, February 3</strong> at <strong>6:00 p.m.</strong>. Bring your favorite snack and join the group as they cheer for the 49ers or the Ravens.</p>
<p>You may pick up a printed directory at either door of the sanctuary as you leave today. There will also be copies in the church office.</p>
<p>We have updated the website to a new format for use on mobile devices. Please check it out and let us know what you think and if anything needs to be added to the site.</p>
<p>So far in 2013, we have been focusing on stewardship. It is no secret that we are suffering the loss of financial support as aged members are passing away and/or moving into assisted living facilities. But stewardship is more than dollars. It is about fully offering ourselves to God. We are engaging Scripture around this topic together in this New Year. We hope that you will continue to join us in this important series as we study Scripture together. The first two weeks in February will compete our Stewardship Series.</p>
